To whom it may concern,


I am writing this letter to recommend my kitten Mica for the graduate program at Stanford in being a good kitty. Mica is a kind soul with many qualities that put her in the highest standard of cat our town has seen in decades. Though she seems to have a permanently forlorn expression, she more than makes up for it through her loving personality and willingness to cuddle and receive belly scratches in order to move up the corporate ladder. Mica is an avid chaser of bugs and at her young age already has several confirmed kills under her beltâ€“a force to be reckoned with. She boasts top speeds of thirty miles an hour. She may be somewhat more reserved than her sister Goose, but her heart is so big that she more than makes up for it. She is happy to spend long hours beside her coworkers keeping them company in their at home work. I am confident that any team would be lucky to have Mica on their side. 


Sincerely, 


Dr. Young
