I write this letter to provide my recommendation for Mr. Michael D. for a summer research position in your group. I have known Michael since 2018 as a summer research assistant in my former lab at the University of Houston (UH). He has a a keen interest in Computational Biology and Network Science, and is one of the most motivated undergraduate students I have met at UH. He very passionately talks about his research and has always been extremely interested to learn more about networks and their specific applications. He is planning a long term career in research along these lines. During his short time in the lab, he made significant contributions to the development of new clustering methods for analyzing biological networks. 
I can more specifically comment on his skills that might be relevant for a potential summer project with you. He can work with Python and C++ independently and reliably. He has experience working on molecular dynamics simulations and clustering of biological data (in particular, configurations of protein molecules evolving in time), a project he worked on in the lab. He is familiar with machine learning algorithms for classification problems, including artificial neural networks. 
Outside of the curriculum, he is an avid reader and a highly creative individual. In his free time he composes music and plays bass guitar in a local band. In my opinion he is intelligent, equally passionate about science & art, and hard working. In conclusion, I strongly recommend him for this position. I strongly believe that given the opportunity, he will be an excellent summer student in your group. 
Please let me know if you have any questions. Sincerely,
