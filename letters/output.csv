"I LOVE Prof. Wager. She\'s hilarious and dedicated. I took this as the hybrid block and I loved it. It is fast paced, but not a ton of work. The final is only a 5 page paper, and you can revise your essays as many times as you want. She really wants you to do well and helps you as much as you can. If I could take every class with her, I would."
Taken as Hybrid course. It was good taking it with this teacher. Especially in a hybrid course she only assigns stuff that is needed. Be aware if you take this in a hybrid class there will be something due EVERY time before the next class. Course work is easy if you are committed to it and turn it in on time. PEER reviews are not accepted late.
"Good teacher, I took this as a second block class on accident. Lots of reading in the class, not super necessary for the lectures. But a fun teacher who\'s excited to share English with students, normal amount of homework assignments and a small 5 page paper due at finals. 8/10"
Wager is a great professor! She makes the class lively and is absolutely hilarious. I took the hybrid-block course. As long as you do the assignments on time it\'s an easy A. The only complaints I have are: a lot of the examples/ content is politically influenced (liberal) and she doesn\'t always describe assignments or what is expected of you well.
Jans does an excellent job of teaching the basics and technical aspects of cinema while putting a feminist/progressive spin on things. Great professor who cares that her class learn new perspectives from her lectures. She is a solid grader and gave great feedback whenever I asked for it. My writing skills have improved from taking this course!
"O\'shea is a easy professor is you do all of the online work, she\'s rude when you try to approach her outside of class. Her power points aren\'t very helpful, and her lectures do not help at all. Her directions when writing papers are very clear, but it is still difficult to receive a good score on them. The work is all online (quizzes and essays)."
"O\'shea is an easy professor if you already know how to write a paper and able to commit your whole life to her class. Her in-class powerpoints and lecture does not match causing you to choose between what she is saying and her slide to take notes. However, its an easy A because its all online. I never went to class and ended with a A."
"This Professor seems to think that students can, and should, read her mind. Trying to write a paper for her is like trying to hit an invisible target. Her directions are vague, yet her expectations when grading are very specific and annoyingly subjective. She is also unnecessarily loud, I\'ve made a habit of wearing earplugs to class."
"She is a wonderful professor and you can tell that she is knowledgeable about history. She makes the class interesting and I ended the class with an A with flying colors. Make sure to follow her essay prompts, do the inquisitive, and have the book open for the test. She also gives bonus points so that\'s a plus. She\'s great!!"
"Class structure is great honestly; just do the online homework, exams, and papers. If you try to speak with her outside of office ours (even if it\'s before or after class) she won\'t talk to you and is quite rude about it. Feedback through e-mails are short and obviously rude. Lectures and PowerPoints are very non-specific and all over the place."
"She is a very good professor, funny, and really knows what she is talking about. Be ready to write several papers with vague guidelines."
"The questions for the papers are poorly defined and can lead to a lot of confusion when writing them. Fair grader. Very boring class, you have to read the book online so there is very little reason to go to her class."
"A hilarious teacher with a sense of passion for what she does. Ask her about the most interesting Roman leader and she will talk your ear off. Papers are tough, but put in the time and you\'ll get a good grade. Need the textbook for the papers. Overall, an awesome professor."
Great professor! Very enthusiastic and cares about her students. She is so genuine and nice. I hate history so this class was boring for me but very easy. Her tests are easy if you go to the review. She tells you whats going to be on the test the class before the test. She doesn\'t give out 100 on her essays but its ok. Overall great woman :)
"I loved her as a professor, really nice woman. Tests aren\'t hard, although the essays can be difficult, but take it to her office hours and have her read it, she will tell you what needs to be fix. Gives opportunities for extra credit here and there."
Professor Kent is extremely smart and makes it clear he wants his students to succeed and understand the material he is teaching. He gives you all the tools you need in order to pass his test. He gives you so much material and lets you know exactly what is on the exam. I would take him again!
Dr. Kent is awesome. His lecture and labs are the most difficult I\'ve ever had but also the best. I graduated the RAD program 2 years ago and his classes helped a ton in the long run. My advice? Worry less about the textbook and a lot more about what he SAYS and writes on the board. If you can\'t listen/recall what he wrote on the board you\'ll fail.
"Dr. Kent is very smart and he makes that very obvious. His tests consists of a lot of critical thinking but he certainly gives you the tools to succeed. He has weekly review sessions to go over essay questions and even gives extra credit for attending them! I would take him again! Do or do not, there is no try! you have to put forth the effort."
"Dr. Kent is a very helpful professor and is willing to help all the time. His tests are hard but he gives you the material to do well on them. He is very caring for his students and wants everyone to be successful. I would take him again if I could. Work hard, ask questions, and go to review sessions and you will do great. He is a great professor."
"Dr. Kent is brilliant and passionate about teaching. He tells his students every day ""If you don\'t understand please stop me."" He truly desires student success but you have to put in your part."
Great professor. Very intelligent and you will learn a lot. If you put the time and effort into the class you will do well. He is always willing to talk and help you out. I would take his classes again.
I cannot understand how anyone can say that Dr. Kent does not offer feedback. He is always available after class and during office hours. He will answer any questions you have but you have to ask. Don\'t expect him to know that you don\'t get something. ASK HIM. Tests are intense but he practically gives you the test in his reviews! STUDY THEM!
"Hands down the best A&P teacher at VSCC. He\'s infinitely knowledgable and doesn\'t just read from slides -- he physically teaches on a chalk board. Extra credit is available on tests as long as you really put effort into studying the material. Sometimes it feels like he\'s moving too slow, but it\'s all because he cares about student comprehension."
"Professor Kent is hands down one of the best professors I\'ve had my college career. He gives a ton of extra credit and tells you exactly what he expects and what he\'ll ask on his exams. He\'s extremely knowledgeable and a great person in general, a real gem. He always comes to class with a smile and a Hawaiian shirt on."
"Kent is a great bio prof! For A and P, I recommend him 110%. I learned so much! It\'s a lot of memorizing, but he gives you study guides, out of class help, and extra credit on exams. Show up and pay attention, and you should get at least a C or better."
"Dr. Kent is one of the best teachers I have ever had. He is very thorough and passionate about his work. He is very approachable, likeable, and generally a nice guy. He gives tons of extra credit on his exams but his exams are tough. He gives a study guide and will tell you what essay questions will be on the exam. You can pass with an A."
"A pretty tough grader, and I\'d say that if he agrees with what you\'re saying, you\'ll do well. Grading is subjective anyways, but he takes it to a new level. Personally, I didn\'t like him too much. The material was pretty interesting on the other hand. My TA this year was incredible though!"
really challenged me to reflect on what it means to hate people...
"The tests can be difficult, but he prepares you well via in class lectures. He keeps the lectures engaging by constantly sharing anecdotes and telling jokes. Attendance is only 4% of the grade, but if you don\'t come to class, be prepared to fail."
"Consistent, organized, knowledgeable; 4 thorough tests-you MUST study. Attendance is expected, hard to make up missed class. Tells real life stories; has refreshing bit of humor; will help student prepare for exam by office hours. You need notes to explain power point lectures. You might manage without book readings but they\'re helpful. Great prof"
"Great professor! The key to getting a good grade in this class is really just paying attention to his lectures, taking good notes, and studying. He makes all the neuroscience material understandable with the way he explains things. He also always provides real-life examples relating to the lecture and they\'re enjoyable to listen to bc he\'s funny."
"Very, very funny guy whose jokes go over heads day in and out. Knowledgeable and will engage with you if you ask thoughtful questions. Can be snarky though, doesnt seem to love having to teach. Tests are VERY text dependant dont dare think you can rely on slides. If you are interested in material, this guy can really help you get it but no easy A"
"Your grade is divided into 3 tests and 1 final exam. All are based on the textbook, yet lectures are just simplified coverage of the textbook. If you aren\'t actively reading the textbook the whole semester (like I did), you\'ll have a very tough time with the tests. Very knowledgeable, but should be avoided for the sake of your GPA."
"He is very knowledgeable in this subject, however he has a hard time passing that on to his students. I am currently sitting in this class completely lost :("
"His exams are incredibly specific and unless you start studying 2 weeks before the exam, do not expect higher than a 70 on any of his tests. I rewrote the entire textbook and went to the learning center to review for his class. I ended up getting an A but I worked for it. He knows his exams are hard though so he\'s a bit more lenient with the gradin"
Wouldnt retake this class with him. Hes good at teachin but for some reason some of the concepts were presented too difficult to remember throughout the course. He does allow cheat sheets for exams but make them quick to understand b. c it can slow you down. Make sure cheat sheets have examples of steps for specific problems rather than definitions
Aaron Kozbelt knows his subject and he knows how to explain concepts. He is organized. His presentations are clear. Would have liked to have him for other courses. Some professors at brooklyn college should be watching him teach so they can brush up on their lecture skills.
"Amazing angel of a professor. Dr. Kozbelt is an interesting professor, his lectures are clear and concise and he is very understanding and reasonable, even in a graduate level class. Take him!"
"Respected, organized and professional. He gives over hard concepts in a clear manner. It\'s a focused setting."
"Professor Loparo is a really cool guy. Gives out extra credits when Indians won and going to class before holidays. The class material is hard but if you do the assigned homework, you will be fine. Quizzes are easy as long as you do the homework. Final is kind of hard but he curves."
"This is a terrible professor who does not care about his students. His homework assignment instructions are vague and if you write a wrong code but has the same output he will show no mercy. He does not explain things well, but expects you to retain the information anyway. I do not know how he is still a professor here at SJSU. Worst experience."
The subject material and the professor\'s teaching style is boring but he does care about his students. There are only 5 homework assignments that add up to 30% of your grade. The rest is 1 midterm and 1 final. He curved both the midterm and final by 15% so many people were able to pass the class. You would have to try hard to fail his course.
"While this subject can be a bit dry, all resources and lectures are posted online. It is an advanced course, with an applied version of SQL on the midterm and knowledge on terms with the final. Most of the class is structured so that while you have the resources, you learn how to actually apply the concepts."
"Very boring lectures, professor lectures while most of class doesn\'t pay attention. Low attendance as semester goes on. If you have to take this class it is not hard as it consists of 4 Hw assignments plus 1 ec hw, 2 midterms, 1 finals, and easy group project. Do well on hw as it worth significant part of grade. Also you get page of notes on tests."
Mr. Shirani is one of the few teachers that gives out very helpful study guides so you know what to study for on the mid/final. 4-5 Homeworks assignments throughout the sem. no group projects. For mid/final study the study guide and in class exercise and you will do fine(write a good cheat sheet)You don\'t have too show up to class.
Lot of students wrote a negative review for saying that his lecture is dry but it\'s more like the topic is somewhat dry. The professor definitely goes above and beyond the textbook and teaches useful programs that are currently used in the MIS field. Really cares about his students & hw is challenging and makes you think. Gives generous extra crdit
"Best math teacher I have ever had. He taught math is a way I could understand and always available for help. Had office hours before class, I would stop in every morning to ask questions either on homework or take home quizzes. Helps you on quizzes or offers you to redo tests for credit. Builds relationships with students, funny and is awesome."
"This professor is AWESOME! If you show him that you care, he will help you raise your grade! Make sure to do your homework and and go to his office before you submit a quiz and after you submit in exam, this will guarantee you to get a higher grade! you willl NOT regret taking this course with him, he\'s the best!"
"You will not regret taking a class with him. I have always struggled with math and thought calc would be impossible for me, but he made it understandable. He\'s very funny, cares about students, and makes a lecture for a very boring subject interesting. The textbook for this class is VERY complicated, so don\'t expect to pass easily if you don\'t show"
He will kick your butt and you will thank him for it. Our class went from 30 students to less than 10 by midterms. Read his powerpoints as he leaves clues as to what he will test on. Listen to his advice and study at least 24 hours a week. Make your own study guides. You have to put in the effort but he will work with you to help you succeed.
"This man is hilarious,wise,inspiring and tries to use example in everyday life. However,Proff Strong is very disorganized. We ended up using lab time for lecture time often and missed material not included in our books and when it came to exam time,a lot of material was indeed not covered. If you\'re lost,you\'ll be directed to THE search engine."
"professor Strong is a really good professor class isn\'t easy ,and you will have to study ,take good notes ,and maybe even watch a couple of videos in order to really understand the material expected to know on Exams .Mr. Strong does tutor after class or before in groups if needed to prepare for exams .No quizzes, No homework Studying is HW"
"I was worried when I decided to take this teacher. This is not an easy class. The teacher is wonderful and takes time to explain the material. If you hope to pass without studying this is not the class for you. If you like to learn from somebody who knows, I recommend this teacher. He is absolutely one of the best. You have to work very hard."
"Prof. Strong is extremely energetic, makes sure everyone is participating throughout labs and lectures. If you put in the effort he will do the same. Skipping a class isn\'t the best idea, he does move quick but the book and powerpoint do help! He makes all of his tests and makes every question critical thinking (really tough)."
"Professor griffin is very rude . She missed class at least three times for personal reasons, which is fine , life happens !!! But lets hope it doesnt happen to you because she will give you an F for missed assignments ! No late turn ins. She is unreasonable . Rude. And unhappy . I worked extremely hard and still for a D . Her grading is bias."
"The absolute worst professor I have ever taken. I have had lots of professors. I am a hard working student who cares about my grades. She is disrespectful,degrading, and worst doesn\'t care at all about the student and just likes to give bad grades just for the fun of it. Also no structure in the classroom; Had to go to her boss just to fix my grade"
I was a first time freshman in college taking Ms. Griffin and she was okay to start off but over time she became very annoying and rude. She was out spoken and spoke to me like i was a child most of the time. She steps out of her place a lot jokingly or not. I wouldnt recommend to anyone
"Dr. Griffin is a great person, very funny and cares. She barely teaches during lectures, and your weekly work was online and would be due at weird times throughout the week. She also had online quizzes and a couple extra credit papers. At the end of the semester we had an APA research paper and a 3-5 min. vlog which was difficult. very tough grader"
"She\'s very goofy; love her as a person, but that doesn\'t matter. She grades really tough and there are quizzes that are due IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY online like every week (which she doesn\'t remind you about). She doesn\'t cancel class, but she will have another professor come in and sub for her."
"She\'s a good professor overall, but if you\'re looking to do nothing and get an A she\'s not for you. She\'s a tough grader, but is there to help if you ask. She\'s adamant about class participation so she\'ll call everyone out at some point. Her class isn\'t easy and only those who really want to learn will stay. My class count went from 30 to about 8."
"The most unreasonable professor I have ever taken. She is extremely rude to her students and talks to them as if they are below her. Gives poor instructions, and doesn\'t provide help. Responds to her students rudely and does not have a problem yelling at them. VERY unprofessional. She is in the wrong field if she is not passionate about teaching."
"Ms. Lashun Griffin is a really great teacher . If you need help? She\'s there to help you. She does grade her papers tough, but her comments and feedback would help you do better. If you want to pass this course, You cannot procrastinate on her class."
Professor Griffin is a fantastic English teacher. She is very caring and yes she is a tough grader but she literally GIVES YOU STEP BY STEP instructions on what she is requiring from you. The class is difficult if you procrastinate and do not stay on top of your game . I am taking her for my English 1302
"I took Mrs. Griffin during my first semester of college. I didn\'t know what I was getting myself into. It was challenging, she was very intimidating, but she did help with giving good feedback on my papers. We had to do like a mid-term timed writing and a 7 page paper, as final, and a presentation of you presenting your thesis that you wrote about"
"I absolutely loved this woman\'s class! She had such a huge impact on me and I\'m sure she doesn\'t even realize it! She is a wonderful teacher and she makes sure that the students make her do her job. ""Don\'t leave this class until you understand, I\'m here because of and for you!"" Wonderful professor I\'ve taken for 1301 & 1302. I would take her again!"
"Kate doesn\'t care what anyone thinks and it\'s awesome. She a feminist and Buddhist with very strong political opinions she won\'t see for herself. Class discussions are always fun, If you have a problem with other people\'s opinions don\'t take her classes."
"Dr. Greene is an excellent professor! She is very opiniated, but she can defend every single one of her views with facts, statistics, etc. Also, if you have a different view, she will let you share with the class because she encourages debate. She will not treat you any differently if you have a different opinion. Do your readings and you will pass"
"Not much homework, all test are written response, but she give awesome test reviews. If you come to class you will pass."
"I highly recommend this professor! She is intelligent and cares about her students very much. I loved her class the most out of all of my political science courses so far. Be prepared to read everything though, and to work for your grade. The tests aren\'t too bad if you read all of the material and keep up with your assignments."
This was such a great class. I learned a lot and it was really easy to pass as long as you showed up and you did the work. She doesn\'t ask a lot of students. There is a 15-20 page paper so beware of that if you decide to take her class.
"I do not remember the course code, but the course was a 300 level and was intro to american legal systems. She was very cool and down to earth. She is not one of the professors who think that because they have a degree, they are better than you. Although the note taking can be confusing at times, she is magnetic and I would recommend to anyone."
"Overall, he\'s just fine. He seems to push his political stance on students every chance he gets and argues with students when they don\'t agree with him. After a while I stopped attending class and still got 100%. If you turn your papers in he will give you the credit and probably not even read them. Its more graded on completion than anything else."
"Prepare for a lot of writing. David is an excellent professor, and is very dedicated to the teaching profession."
"David really cares about his students and their success. He does require lots of reading, but it is all very interesting. If you love history you like this class. He does have lots of papers but most of them are 1 page papers. He has options to do service learning or outside learning for extra credit and allows revisions of papers. Amazing teacher!"
"He\'s very understanding and an overall great person. He cares for the students; thus he doesn\'t punish you for not attending class or turning in assignments late. Articles on D2L used to take notes and write a short essay. Time consuming but very easy. He does service learning so I got enough e.c to skip writing a final paper. OH YEAH, NO EXAMS"
"I loved David\'s class. Ancient history usually isn\'t my thing, but he found subjects that could spark students interest. He is very supportive of his students, and occasionally goes on little rants about how WE are in charge of our education, not the other way around, and actually told us to come here to do research on our professors. Really great!"
"Dr. Rayson was, by far the best professor I had in my time at Normandale. He is truly inspired me to do better in each assignment i handed in. His tests are essays in which you will know about weeks in advance. He allows revisions to these essays until you get the grade you want. I highly recomend this instructor to anyone."
Super funny and nice guy. His class is pretty easy and you can retake your assignments.
"Professor Smith will make you work for an A, but it IS achievable! Stay ahead with your papers, writing a paper the night before will not cut it. The worst thing you can do to yourself is skip his class. Pop quizzes are frequent, but easy if you take notes when he lectures and review them!! Put in the work, you will do great!"
"Difficult an inaccessible teacher. He is one of the teachers that don\'t care about students. mean and inconsiderate. very boring lectures, stupid quizzes. Find another teacher if you can!"
"To save yourself do not take this class. Max is like a robot and his lectures are boring. He gives pop quizzes, which stinks, and he only grades your grammar and punctuation. He also does not give good feedback, and is unorganized. If he mixes up your papers with another class you will get an F on that paper. For your own good, DO NOT TAKE HIM!!!!!"
I don\'t know why everyone else is complaining so much about this class. It is a very easy A. If you show up and do your homework you will pass. He is a very easy grader if you have basic writing skills (or just check your grammar with Grammarly). His class is incredibly boring though and there are daily quizzes (very easy though).
"I had Smith for freshmen composition. He was a decent teacher, but one thing I noticed was he didnt really care about the writing aspect of your paper. As long as the grammar was near perfect you got an A. Also the quizzes he gives are stupid and basically re worded from the last quiz. Good thing they only make up 10%. Also dont miss class."
It seems that when it comes to papers this professor doesn\'t care much about the writing. Instead he cares more on the punctuation. His quizzes are random and repeated. His lectures don\'t relate much to actually English.
"Smith is a very unemotional/robotic professor. He is a decent English professor, but he expects professionalism out of his students. There are pop quizzes at least twice a week, but they are always very easy. Do not get caught procrastinating on your papers because he catches small mistakes very easily."
"simply the worst professor I\'ve ever had, doesn\'t care for students, gives little to no sympathy what so ever, hard to talk to, and just not a nice guy. I recommend not taking this class, he is a tough grader, does meaningless quizzes"
"Daily attendance. Grades aren\'t posted, so your grade is unknown till the end. Make sure you listen closely to lectures and take detailed notes. 2-3 quizzes a week. He spends class time talking about different essay topics instead of essay writing techniques/strategies, but if you work hard and follow his instructions closely, an A is attainable."
"Definitely not an easy ""A"", but it is possible. Total of 8 Essays including the final the essay. There are pop quizzes but if you attend class they\'re not too bad. Attendance is absolutely mandatory! 6 absences and your grade will drop a whole letter, and there are no excuses, Smith isn\'t very understanding. Try toFind a different prof. if you can!"
"I\'m torn about this professor. There was a distinct rudeness from him at times that was very degrading and stand-offish. I want to maybe believe he is too intelligent to communicate with people of regular emotion? At times he was understanding, other times I felt his subtext was saying ""You are an idiot and I am more intelligent than you."""
"This is the only professor I\'ve had that refuses to put grades in the gradebook. I am paying a lot of money for his class so it is lazy of him to not simply do something nice for his students. He is hard to talk to, extremely boring, and only does things that are convientent for him. It almost seems as if he can care less about his students."
"difficult teacher, unless you\'re an advid writer do not take his class,He will not help you even if you ask for it,directions can at times be unclear,rude when you try to ask something, doesnt like being corrected even if you point a mistake out nicely,you can tell he is not inspired to teach anymore, dean refunded me right away without hesitation."
"Ian is a wonderful professor! He\'s thoughtful, understanding, and he loves a good class discussion. No quizzes, no test, just two writing assignments and a presentation. He gives great feedback on everything. He sometimes shares food with the class (ask about his walnut paté), but he never shares the recipes - no matter how often you ask! :)"
"Dr. Ian was one of the best professors Ive had at Eastern Michigan. I would recommend his section to everyone that wants to teach early education. Hes super relatable, funny, and has the most adorable British accent. Absolutely loved this guy."
"I\'ve had Ian so many times I\'ve lost count. Genuinely wonderful both as an educator and as a person. Each time I\'ve had him, I\'ve been asked to examine literature in new and impactful ways. Respectful and interested in the opinions of his students. You can\'t get away with not reading the books, though, so don\'t try it. He\'ll know. Highly recommend."
"He is a solid professor, and has his teaching assistants do most of his work for him. You\'re graded on a couple quizzes, tests, and papers. It\'s lecture heavy, but the slides that go with it are pretty informational so if you miss a class or two it won\'t kill your grade. We read a lot, but they also go in depth about the books."
"Great Professor. Had him for 207 and again for 455. Great in the big lectures, but try and take a smaller class with him if you can. He\'s the only professor at Eastern who even bothered to learn my name. Really wants to hear what you have to say. Challenging, but not unfairly so. Highly recommended."
"If you actually talk to him he is really sweet! If he knows you from talking with you he will help you out, most of the quizzes are group quizzes and he gives you the answers and extra credit! You have to read a lot but a lot is from the lectures. I would definitely recommend!"
"Dr. Andrews is a great professor, I loved his class! He gives many extra credit opportunities, you just need to read all of the texts to pass."
"He\'s a great lecturer but he doesn\'t have an email, and doesn\'t post notes online so be prepped to write your own good notes as he lectures fast. Also I wouldn\'t be concerned about asking questions in class as he will ignore you. He marks harder than my 300 level profs & doesn\'t give remarks on how to do better just calls undergrads stupid a lot"
"Whether or not you like him will depend on your style. Dr. B gives a lot of hw and tests frequently. This is actually helpful because you get a lot of opportunities to make corrections to your grade. 7 or 8 tests total, 3 of which are in class with a group. He talks a lot and often doesn\'t finish lecture, so prepare to spend time in the TA help lab"
"Physics is a really hard course because of the department. I don\'t usually rate my professors, but even though this class was so hard for me, cuz I\'m no physics major, he really is one of the greatest professors. He cares about his students. He\'s brillant He\'s definitely worth taking the class from. He\'ll put in extra time outside of lecture!!"
"Dr. Bergeson is the best professor I\'ve ever had. He\'s goofy and eccentric and keeps his lectures entertaining, and somehow learned almost all of the names of every student in each of his 150 student classrooms. He teaches the material simply, and tests on what he\'s taught us in class - nothing came as a surprise, ever. Very accessible."
"A great professor for a great class! If you do all the work and study sufficiently for the test, it\'s an easy A. Dr. Bergeson is really good and explaining things and making lecture interesting."
"Definitely take physics from him, he actually cares about the students and does everything he can to make sure you learn. He also cares about your grade so he doesn\'t punish you for not knowing how to do everything and gives you several chances to learn. The tests aren\'t hard just study and do the homework and you\'ll get a good grade"
"I dreaded Physical Science before the semester started; I never would have guessed it would end up being my favorite class! I really appreciate how this class broadened my understanding of science and how the material was clear, but also challenged my mind. I learned a lot, I laughed a lot (like, a LOT), and I\'m really going to miss this class."
Good if you are prepared to take responsibility for your learning and review a lot outside of class
"Dr. Bergeson is a fantastic professor, he is able to teach difficult subjects in a gripping way. He cares about his students and knew a substantial amount by name (in a class with 100 students). Lectures are interesting, and despite first appearance, the vigorous testing and homework schedule is actually very manageable."
Solid fella. Science made entertaining!
"Dr. Bergeson is a great professor and lecturer. It was in a large class but still individualized it by letting students ask questions and help with examples. The lectures are based on enhancing the textbook reading, so if you read the book, you\'ll be great."
"I clickers, homework every night, test every two weeks, assigned readings that have nothing to do with physics besides justifying his teaching schedule. But he is really passionate. Imagine Vlad the Impaler for gym trainer. You\'re gonna get results but gonna but it\'s gonna hurt! You\'re taking this class because you have to. Don\'t take Vlad."
Outstanding prof. The very best.
"I don\'t know why people are so bitter towards this prof, she\'s actually great. Gave out 3% in free bonus marks to basically everyone. The midterm on the syllabus said chapters 1-7, she made it easier by only covering chapters 2,3,4, and 7. I studied total 12 hrs for midterm and got an A. Content on tests were directly from textbook and lectures."
"Prof Abert is definitely a prof I will never take again, nor will I recommend him to anyone. I ended up catching the flu and missed the first test and he never responded to any of my emails and when I returned and asked to make up the test he said no and walked away. The test I did take had 10 questions. Also, be prepared for nonstop homework..."
"Hes a thorough instructor. If your a math or engineering major hes your guy. If not, like I am not, then he is not your guy. Got an A but he defiantly makes you work for it. Will ensure you are prepared for future math classes."
"Entire class consists of him doing examples. He might briefly talk about the concept to introduce it. Homework is on LonCapa which is the worst! If you bring him the question, he\'ll do it for you though. Tests are alright if you review. He\'s a good person, but not the best teacher. Trig is hard, and he doesn\'t really make it easier. No book needed."
"Abert is a genuinely nice person and shows enthusiasm. He will only invest in you if he sees that you invest yourself in learning the material. This is math people, you are inevitably going to practice constantly in order to fully grasp what you are learning. The hw problems aren\'t ever too challenging. If you do the hw the tests should be eazy."
"I love math it\'s easily my favorite subject. This professor is very passionate and does an excellent job of explaining things. I\'m not a fan of liberal arts math because I hate word problems, he does an amazing job teaching and it was np for me. Attendance isn\'t mandatory but I took it as express and if you skip, you will easily fall behind."
"Professor Abert was an all around decent professor for Calc 2. He struggles in teaching you new material right off the bat, and typically expects that you will have read the section being covered in class before hand. He doesn\'t curve or drop lowest test grade, but he is a very easy grader on tests, and gives a lot of partial credit on problems."
"No comment. He is awesome. if not, you are not doing what you have to do for a math class. Do not complain you teacher."
"He is very knowledgeable and explains the material well, but his lecture can seem never-ending and his homework problems are a lot harder than the ones he goes over in class. They are also very long (some with 40 questions) but he gives you normally over a week to complete. I would suggest taking MWF to have shorter lectures or else you\'ll zone out"
get ready to take notes. he writes them all on the black boards and doesn\'t post anything online. If you miss class you wont have any idea what\'s going on unless you go to his office hours
Good at explaining new material. Moves at the perfect pace. Will answer any of your questions perfectly. Tests are a lot easier than the home works. Gives partial credit on tests. Tests are only 45% of the grade so if you fail one dont worry.
"He is a great teacher do not get me wrong, but he is teaching format is for students who clearly grasp the concept of math! i am terrible at math and i did terrible in this class! DO ALL HOMEWORKS! ATTEND ALL CLASSES! If you are good at math i advise you take this class because it may be easier for you."
He is a Mathematics man. Awesome. I had him for precal and will take him all of myh maths if I can
"Don\'t do it unless you are familiar with Mac 1105. I\'m a straight A student & had a difficult time. Test seem to have nothing to do with what you\'ve studied. Don\'t normally rate professors unless necessary Nice person, but has a cocky, show off style of teaching. If you\'re not somewhat familiar with Mac 1105, DON\'T DO IT, YOU\'LL REGRET IT."
"Mr. Abert was not my favorite professor. There were times that he would preform examples in lecture wrong, and he could not correct them. The lectures were unclear and hard to follow. Also, the tests were very hard compared to examples we had done in class and after talking to classmates, it was a communal feeling that we were not prepared for them"
"Very real professor who gives no BS. She tells you the way it is and what the history really was like. She gives her opinion (which tend to be very strong), but hears other peoples opinions and respects them. Learned so many great things from this class and professor; highly recommend!"
"I\'ve previously taken the online course to avoid the in class nonsense. Didn\'t make a difference with her grading and lack of communication (emails). Never the less, Jenni expects the most out of her students. No excuses are tolerated. You\'ll read 4 books in 1 semester . If you don\'t complete the book reviews you will fail. Honesty doesn\'t matter"
"Expect to read 4 novels during this course. No textbook, but she puts all relevant readings online for students. Expect to have to read an article and answer questions as homework for every class. Most of your grade comes from the extremely important book reports. Most class periods are spent gathering in a large circle and discussing as a class."
"DO NOT TAKE HER. I hated her class and dreaded going. Not only was it a waste of time but also a waste of money. I learned nothing. She never went over the class material, she talked basically current events the whole time when this was a class about the 1800\'s. Expected to read 4 chapter books on top of all the other articles she assigned."
"She is super strict. If you do not complete something, be ready to be kicked out of class. She thinks her class is the only thing going on in our life\'s. She assigns mass amounts of homework to be due immediately. Random pop quizzes are huge. If you think you can come to class and review what you just read, forget it. You should know everything!"
"Tim\'s a cool professor who cares about his students, -sometimes really hard to reach outside of class. Lectures felt very long sometimes because he tends to talk a lot sometimes, but makes them more interesting with visual aids. There\'s a lot of reading that we did, but he breaks it up so if you keep up you\'ll be fine! Looking forward to part 2/2."
"This SFI class was definitely my favorite course from my first year at SSU. Tim offers really interesting and inspiring points of view, gives really awesome lectures, and is working for the good of his students. The class depends on the books, films and short stories, but its for sure fun and interesting if you put your mind and heart into it"
"He\'s ridiculously vague and biased. There is no point in arguing with him. If you disagree with him, you\'re wrong. He started off his first class with the statement ""I\'m more liberal than Hillary Clinton."" No relevance to the course, but an accurate start to this class that is better off being called ""An Hour and Fifty Minutes of Tim\'s Opinions"
"Show up and pass, easy grader, be sure to review powerpoint slides before tests and you will pass."
"I love Craig! His zoology class was really interesting and he\'s so adorable in a sweet nerdy way. Honestly he\'s my favorite teacher I\'ve ever had! I just love his personality, however, His class was extremely hard for me. I ended up getting a C and they was a miracle. The tests where you had to identify species by their scientific names were horrid"
"Craig is amazing. At first you\'ll find him quirky and different but he grows on you. I made the mistake of missing lecture a lot and that really affected my grade because EACH lecture he grades and gives points for participation. He does offer A LOT of extra credit and his discussions are outdoor and super hands on. We did a lot, good experience"
"Craig is my absolute favorite teacher of all time, I have taken zoology and man & environment with him and I am going on his field bio class to Costa Rica this winter. Zoology means a lot of memorizing but he gives a ton of extra credit on the tests and in the class in general so it is easy to do well. Man & environment was the easiest class ever."
"I took this class during the summer, we went outside almost every single day to walk along the lake, in the woods,& sometimes to do some very messy &gross activities. Going to class & outside earns you participation pts. He is not very good at conveying material in class so you NEED to read the book to do well on exams. There is LOTS of memorizing."
Craig is an awesome teacher! You can really tell he is passionate about what he teaches. Also the class is a bit hard (10+ exams) but there is so much extra credit you can still pass with a good grade. You also do go outside a lot but it\'s a lot of fun! This was my Favorite class & professor and I wish I could take it again.
Me Stettnar is a really good teacher. His lectures are very understanding.
He comes off weird at first but you\'ll get used to it. He knows his stuff and he\'s truly so nice! He offers a lot of extra credit and chances to do them so he wants you to pass! You can do bad on the exam and still pass the class with a B with all the extra credit opportunity. He crams a lot of questions on the exams too!
"Craig is an amazing teacher, probably my favorite and I do not like science classes. He\'s quirky and a little weird at first but you will love him by the end, he\'s hilarious. Do not take bio 103/104 if you do not like going outside because that is all you do. If you do like going outside, it\'s an easy A. No homework except to read. Study for tests."
"This is a great class to take for people with no previous experience. He will help you get through every speech. Tests are so easy, as long as you put in effort and show up, youll be fine"
He Has Us To A Lot Of Speeches & Quizzes. Bought 2 Books But Only Used One. Is An Okay Grader. Would Choose Someone Else...
"I feel like I actually had to work for the A in this class for both the exams and the speech. So if you are taking a lot of classes and you want an easy A for speech, I suggest you take this class over the summer because you are required to work hard for the A. Also, you have to practice for the speech to get a good grade as well as read the book."
"Very approachable professor. Understands that public speaking can be nervous to many, so he isn\'t harsh when he gives criticism. His grading is easy to understand. Overall, practice your speeches ahead of time so that you\'ll be in a good spot. There are a few exams as well, so you do have to read some chapters if you want to do well on those."
He makes you feel at ease and his grading method is clear and precise. He is also very approachable. I highly recommend him if you have never taken speech and super nervous about it.
"Really good professor. He cares about his students and always wants them to improve. He knows everyone fears of public speaking but he makes the class a friendly environment. Tests are easy. Never opened the purple book. I used the white one to help me with our speech outlines. Very kind. You have 6 free absence passes. If you go over, you fail."
He generously grades speeches even if they are bad and understands public speaking is hard. He wants you to succeed and was my first professor in college to see good in me. The tests are easy as long as you read the book. I\'ve learned so much in this class so if you take SPE101 be sure to take him!! Ask about extra credit I got 25 points added!
"Mr. B is very enthusiastic about speech, he loves what he does and it shows. Hes very easy to talk to, and will give you feedback on his thoughts of your speech. He creates a comfortable environment in his classroom so when you go up to speak it isnt scary. You must show up to his class or you wont pass, he keeps track of attendance."
Great Professor! Really helped me out with every little detail of my speech and didn\'t seem to rest until we both knew it was the best I could do. Very great Professor and a very great man.
"Mr. B. is the best speech professor anywhere. I HATE public speaking, but Mr. B. made us feel comfortable and laid back. He grades on improvement, not by expectation, meaning if you do poorly on one speech, but try harder and do better on the next one, he will take that improvement into account and boost your grade. He just wants to see you try :)"
"One of the most enriching classes I have taken during my undergrad. Dr. Siegfried cares not only about her students but about their academic achievement and challenges you to become a better writer, thinker, and human. Her expectations are incredibly high and getting an A is a challenge, so get ready to read and write but the work is well worth it"
"Hardest grader in the BYU English department AND you have to get a 95 to get an A. Basically means that getting an A is impossible (though A- is achievable for the work of an A+ in a different English class). Learned a ton, but worked a ton for it as well. Dont regret taking the class but probably wouldnt take again."
"Brandie has the highest expectations of any prof I\'ve had at BYU. She makes you earn every single point on tests, papers, and participation. Getting an A from her is a real challenge. BUT she\'s the best prof I\'ve had. I learned SO MUCH from her and will take every class I can from her in the future. If you really care about your edu, take Brandie"
"Prof. Siegfried teaches her subject so well and in such depth you actually learn truths about life and not just forgettable test garbage. She will invest in you. Prof. Siegfried has written me 4+ quality letters of recommendation (first job, law school app, and after). Dont be afraid of getting a B+ and learning from the best English Prof. at BYU."
Don\'t take this class if you care about your grades. I got high A\'s on everything (including second test and the final) except for a B on the first test and a B+ on one paper and I got a B- in the class. You are required to comment multiple times each period. Have to keep a time consuming journal. This class is absolutely not worth the effort.
"Brandie is one of the best professors at BYU. She makes you work for it, but you cannot help but be completely engaged in her class and come away totally psyched about what you learned. She is a hard grader with a lot of assignments, but if you\'re not lazy, taking her class will be one of the best academic experiences you\'ll ever have."
"Great lectures and articulates the concepts very well. Course materials are very well organized. He provides slides that are fill-in-the-blank so you pay attention, and it\'s not hard to with this teacher. He also records his lectures along with the slides which is a big bonus."
"The lectures were clear, concise, and they made sense. Prof. Kraay was well spoken and always knew what he was talking about. He could answer any question the students asked him about the material."
"I freakin love this man. Best professor I have ever had. His lectures are so clear and concise, he knows exactly how to speak so that everyone paying attention really understands. He also records his lectures and posts them so that students who miss class can easily catch up. His tests are very fair and true to the content. I loved him and his work"
such an easy course if your at least somewhat smart
"pretty easy as long as u have him. just write what he emphasizes in class and you are golden. dont ever try to write in ur own words, just write down (to highest degree) what he says in class and lecture notes."
"Exams are based on things discussed in lecture so you need to go to class. Papers are graded exceptionally tough, he doesn\'t bell curve but the average always tended around a C. Even if you make the improvements based on his comments, it won\'t mean you\'ll get a better grade because of how subjectively he marks."
This class is an easy A. Kraay makes the content easy to grasp with tons of examples and his lectures are great! Would 100% take his course again!
"If you don\'t go to class you wont pass at all. YOU CANNOT MISS ONE CLASS. He leaves blanks in his power-points and you are only able to find the answers in class. At the end of the class he does not re-post the power-points with the missing words, so you are unable to study off of them if you miss a class. And there is no textbook to look at. DONT."
"i was nervous because many reviews i read said the course gets difficult. i didn\'t find that it was difficult at all, and i\'m not really a student that keeps up with work. i never even opened my textbook and i always left class 15-30 minutes early for my next one across campus. you can tell he enjoys the topic and care about his students"
This class probably gave me the most anxiety. I was literally shaking before each evaluation. This class is composed of 4 quizzes. Final is 35%. Prof Kraay is definitely one of the best profs at Ryerson. My anxiety probably had to do with the fact that I was a 1st year student at that time but it also did not help having the lecture Friday evenings
Amazing prof. Take SSH 105 with him and you\'re golden!
A great prof and person overall. Tests are always reasonable and to the point. Lectures were always interesting and he even uploads the audio of his lectures which is a GREAT help to auditory listeners!!
"Klaas was a great prof. Critical Thinking is an incredibly boring and slow course, but you could tell he was passionate about it and really knew the material well (I\'m pretty sure he played a role in writing the curriculum?) He posts the audio and powerpoint slides for every lecture on d2l, so you don\'t have to go to class. Overall a great class"
Profesor Hafeez is an okay math professor. She knows the material pretty well. The only reason you need to attend class is because of the poppers. If you don\'t get something you can always ask her questions.
"Not a very good teacher. Lectures are long and you walk away learning nothing. Don\'t take her - I respect her origins, but she has a heavy accent and it\'s quite hard to understand her sometimes. Also, she is BAD AT MATH. Makes MANY mistakes and often confuses the entire class. Stay away from her if you\'re taking her in a big lecture..."
"I am currently in 1311 online with professor Hafeez. The class layout is very clear. Email response was ok at times response were short & unclear. More importantly, this was an easy A, if you do the homework, take every quiz and remember the poppers. There are several opportunities to do well. I have never been a math person and I did very well!"
"This online class has lectures twice a week. There are pop quizzes (poppers) in every lecture, practice exams mimic the real exams and your grade on the practice gives you extra credit toward the exams. You have 20 attempts to get 100 on your quizzes and practice exams. You have the option to opt out of the final if you maintain a B or above."
"There is a slight communication barrier with her speech which is manageable but, her email etiquette is not very good. She doesn\'t read your questions fully and answers only half of your questions IF she even responds. Her lectures can be confusing because she gets lost. Her syllabus was very unorganized including the calendar."
"This class is really what you put into it. The Homework really helped if you at least try to do it before going to class. It was a usual Math class, she would solve math problems with everyone and she will answer any question we had. The class can be easy if you really do the homework."
"Ms. Hafeez isn\'t a bad professor, but she\'s not going to spoon feed you. If you\'re good in math and have good study habits, I would say take her. If not, it\'s best to take someone else. She goes pretty fast so it can be hard to understand what\'s going on. I passed with an A but I studied my butt off. Her reviews help a ton for tests."
"She tends to be unorganized, messy with her handwriting and unattentive to the blackboard chat when we, as the students, try to correct her. It was to the point where I actually had to not go to her online class anymore because all she did was confuse me more than she taught me. All in all, I got an A by self-study and teaching."
"Currently in her class and it\'s so easy! just pay attention to her notes, do the practice tests, poppers and quizzes and you should be fine.10% of your grade from your practice test is added to the exam grade. Also if you\'re happy with your grade after the 3 exams you don\'t have to take the final. She is very sassy and sarcastic but i find it funny"
"Ms. Hafeez seemed ill-prepared for class, and normally just winged her teaching. Still, as long as you do the homework, quizzes, and in-class ""poppers"" (daily-work that she uses to check attendance), than you\'ll be fine. This class is easy to pass, as long as you do the necessary work."
"This is a review for her WINTER MINI SESH STATS 2311 First of all, she\'s very engaging in her live lectures. She cares a lot about her students, often offering to meet w/ us at UH to help. Since this course is only a month long, it\'s reasonable that she goes at fast pace, so pay attention or self study a little. 3 Tests, quizzes, and poppers."
"Hafeez is extremely sarcastic and a bit stubborn but overall a good teacher and is willing to answer any questions you may have. Poppers every class session, but are easy. Homework and EMCF due every week, 3 tests and an optional final to replace lowest test grade."
"I took her course online and although I didn\'t like the online aspect, I truly loved her teaching. She is very funny and caring of her students. She will stay after class hours and help those who need it. I selected lecture heavy because it\'s all online so it is, lol. Watch her lectures, do her work, & the test will be very easy! An A is possible!"
"I had some health issues this semesters and she was very caring and willing to help. Class was a little boring, it\'s mostly just grading your grammar worksheets together, I almost wish it had been a little bit more challenging. Careful though, she was a much tougher grader than I expected for the big projects."
Professor Shelton was by far the best English professor I have ever had. She works with each student personally in order for them to be as successful as possible. She also has you work on one subject all semester long so all of the work you do is helping you develop your final paper. She is super compassionate and loving to all!
"She is like the little grandma that everyone wishes they had. She wants her students to pass and will help them make that possible. If she sees your effort, she will work with you. The whole semester was spent on writing the final paper, by building it piece by piece. She\'s funny and really helpful."
"She was a good english professor. There were times in her class where she loved talking about political and controversial things, which wasn\'t too relevant to english. But overall, she stayed on track. Her grading for papers is very fair and she gives great feedback on how you can improve. I would take her class again."
I loved taking this class from Linda. She is great! She was very understanding about everything. I turned in a few assignments late and she didn\'t mark me down for it. All she really cares is that it is completed and that we did out best. There are a lot of papers but she is willing to help you and accommodate.
She is literally THE BEST. She wants her students to succeed and wants you to get the best grade possible in her class. She does one on one conferences when it comes to midterms and your final paper. And she doesn\'t do a finals test! Your last research paper is your final and you finish the class a week early! Definitely has been my favorite.
"Linda is the kind of professor that makes you love the subject. Grammar is tolerable at its best, but Linda made it interesting and fun. She is a very skilled instructor and she knows her subject matter. I believe attendance is key for receiving an A, but I never wanted to miss her class, so this wasn\'t a problem."
"This class is pretty challenging. Consists of 1 group project completed in class, 2 tests, and many homework assignments. Chen is a great professor but the topic is hard to grasp. You must put effort and time in this class to do well. Show up to class, read chapters, and ask questions and you should do okay. Confusing class but it is manageable."
"This class is really hard if you let it be. You just have to pay attention in class, do all the homework and class activities, get C\'s on the tests and you will do fine. Dr. Chen is a cool lady and really relaxed. She teaches really boring classes but does her best to help you learn the material."
"She is a great professor that will go out of her way to help you. Class is interesting, however, there are some concepts that are hard to grasp. There really isn\'t much homework at all, other than reading the chapters from the book. There are 3 quizzes and a final, but the final is just questions from the 3 quizzes. Read, Go to class and take notes"
"A really great professor, she knows her stuff. You need to pay attention in class and seek help outside of class or you will fail the exams. Midterm and finals were both hands on. Final project used concepts from the entire semester. The textbook is only used for studying so if you can borrow someones do that. Attendance is mandatory."
The class is really tough due to lack of introductory material. It jumps you right into the nitty gritty. Her tests are really hard but if you do well on the assignments and projects you are sure to get at least a B
"Dr. Chen is an excellent professor! She cares deeply about the success of her students and she is always willing to help. Pay attention during her lectures, take notes, and ask questions. She is the best professor I have had a Ball State."
"She\'s deffinatly my favorite ISOM professor. She gets students engaged in class and connects with you one-on-one. Available for help and if you don\'t understand something, ask and she\'ll clear things up and bring it to a level thats relatable to you. You have to work for a good grade. Loved the class though."
She will unleash the beast if she catches you with ANY technology in your hand. Most difficult class I have ever experienced. Professor seems as though she hates her life and likes to take it out on innocent students. Lecture slides are irrelevant and she talks too quick to catch anything. DROP THIS CLASS ASAP.
Generic intro course lectures. I found them interesting and useful for classes I have taken since then.
"TESTS are HARD! Not enough time to answers questions. Questions are irrelevant to anything, they are random, and there\'s no way anyone would know the correct answer. Don\'t take this class."
"She really knows her stuff, but her lecture slides aren\'t very helpful. Offers extra credit quizzes a couple times throughout the semester so I\'d go to lectures"
Her lectures were incredibly specific and too advanced for an introductory class. She would wonder why no one was understand anything and the concepts were uninteresting in the way she presented them. She doesn\'t seem to care about the intro class at all. Is only in it for her own research.
"She didn\'t let the class use technology to take notes, but it didn\'t matter as she provided the power point slides on ICON, all I had to do was print them off. I recommend taking notes directly on the power point slides she provides for the class. Exams are over lectures and the textbook. She explains everything in detail. A lot of extra credit!"
"Solid professor, Attendance & Lateness is key. Get there on time and pay attention, you\'ll be fine. Not the best but not the worst either."
"Professor Karras is stern and speaks in a monotone manner. He didn\'t show much of his personality. He\'s a reserved, fair guy. Pick your karate partner wisely because you\'ll be stuck with them all semester. My partner had a nice body so you know I was chillin :^D There\'s no flying kicks in this class. It\'s mostly defensive grappling maneuvers"
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!! Worst class i have ever taken. First off the class is located in the colleges wrestling room which smells absolutely terrible and the mats are infected with a skin fungus known as ring worm!! He makes you stand infront of class and perfom kerate moves, embarrasing!! He can be very irrational. And rude. STAY AWAY!!"
"Vinnie is the best professor I\'ve had by far. His lectures were the most interesting I\'ve ever sat in. You can tell he really cares about his job and it shows in his energy. The workload: no homework, 3-4 really easy mc quizzes, and two straightforward essays. Easy A if you go to lecture and actually listen and take notes."
Still my favorite professor to date.
"Hays is definitely set in her ways but shes fair. Her rules are simple I dont know why its hard for people to follow them. Dont be on your phone, come to class prepared and dont disrupt class. She wants the answers on tests in a specific way but she gives you exactly what you need to study word for word so its not hard"
This class is a complete waste of time; the entire class time is spent filling out worksheets with no explanation on how to actually teach the material to children. Her tests are mostly fill in the blank/short answer and are 100% information from the book that has nothing to do with what is gone over in class.
"Hays is a very serious professor. As long as you don\'t eat or drink something other than water, she will like you. You should NEVER use your phone in her class or she will call you out. She lets you make up lost points for assignments as long as you turn them in on time. Make sure you come to class because Edmodo is a large part of your grade!"
"She\'s mediocre at best. Her classes can be fun and are very easy. however, her tests have nothing to do with lectures and she is very picky when it comes to testing and projects. She can be pretty rude and doesn\'t allow food in the classroom aside of water. She is sweet at times but can be pretty mean that second later. Overall, I got a highly B."
"She\'s is very rude. Focus too much on irreverent things. Doesn\'t even teach, she just reads off the handouts. She\'ll call you out if you\'re chewing gum or eating food, which is very childish. If there\'s another teacher teaching this class, TAKE IT. Horrible teacher."
"Class seems easy. Attendance and Edmodo count a lot. Does not allow, food, gum, cell phones, nor drinks in the classroom, not even if its a 3hr long period. Other than that class is not that bad. her tests can be hard, but if you look over the chapter and notes, test should not be too hard. She would send out a review for the test, pretty helpful"
"Sassiest professor I\'ve ever had. No drinks or food other than water. But, over all her class was pretty easy if you show up, do her daily reflections, and follow her syllabus to the dot. Lot of papers to keep up with. I ended up dividing mine by week in a binder."
"She is one of the rudest professors I have ever taken. She will not let you eat or drink in class unless it\'s from a water bottle. No sodas or coffee. She goes over activities in class, but her tests are NOTHING like what she goes over. She will call you out if you\'re caught on your phone or you\'re talking while she is talking. Beware of her!!"
"Prof. Harding is an amazing professor. The content of the class was pretty tough and he did an amazing job teaching it to us. Be prepared to read and write, there were about 6 novels we had to read for this course. Show up and show him that you care and you will be fine."
"This class was alright, but sometimes he was rude to students in class. The papers were a challenge, and the take home exams were no breeze. I would not take him again."
"As an English major, I absolutely adored Dr. Harding. His classes were intellectually stimulating and I always felt challenged to understand literature in a more in-depth way. Dr. Harding offers students the opportunity to revise papers, gives students incredible feedback, and makes his class very interactive."
"Wonderful professor. Generous with her time. Cares about students. Gives honest, helpful feedback. Knows her stuff. One of my favorite classes at OU."
"She is a wonderful professor. She\'s fun and slapstick, but is not someone to take advantage of. She knows her stuff, and she wants to help all her students learn and succeed with their writing goals."
"Where to start? Annie is the BEST. I honestly owe so much of my academic and personal growth to her. She takes time both in class and out of class to make sure her students are okay and understand everything. Supportive, fun, AMAZING. Love her. Mentor, teacher, supporter. Speaks her mind and supports you for doing the same. Favorite prof ever."
"She\'s weird, but in a good way. You\'ll read a lot in her capstone, but it\'s a very inviting and pleasant atmosphere. She\'s a professor that really truly engages with what she reads and works hard to make sure everyone is just as excited about the novels. Some work - but it\'s one of the most memorable classes I\'ve taken here."
"She\'s been an incredible mentor for not only me, but many others. She keeps her students in mind and updates on possible internshipsjobeducational opportunities. She has your back if you put the effort in--grades on development. LISTEN to her advice, and always ask questions. Don\'t be afraid to speak up. Hands-down, the best professor at OU."
Hes very rude and talks nonsense to the whole class. He gives out answers but changes the subject too much. I feel like I am not getting the proper learning I should be getting. Hes worse by far. I dont understand how hes an easy class of does not teach but talk useless information. I am trying to get a career here.
He gives 10 bonus points every test plus extra credit constantly. You don\'t have to show up but if you do youll get the extra credit. Constantly tells nutty stories.
He is very easy going. The class is not boring. He helps you to get a good mark.
"Amazing professor. First day of class he said he has 2 PHD\'s and it definitely shows. He doesn\'t lecture word for word from the book but uses his real life experiences to teach us. He is hilarious and kind. Super easy course and a joy to be taught by him! If you have a chance, take him."
"Lectures about himself. unbelievable stories. Guy is stuck in the 1960\'s. Literally didn\'t show up for our final. Easy A if you show up, but if your paying out of pocket not from financial aid or mommy and daddy. I was hoping to learn more. Very outdated teaching style. If your taking for credits, go for it. If you want to learn. forget about it"
Interesting! I wasn\'t sure I would pass at first because his style of teaching is a lot different. But as long as you read the chapters and go to class you will pass. His lectures are awesome. You will learn a lot about life. Brilliant man!
"Dr Frank Mitchell is hands down the best instructor I\'ve ever had the pleasure of learning from. He is kind and intelligent, and he cares about his students and is more than willing to make himself available and approachable. He explains the material in a way that is understandable. I plan on taking more of his classes in the future. LOVE HIM"
"Professor Mitchell\'s class was my 1st college course taken in 18 years. His technique annoyed me at first, but once I got the hang of his style, he wasn\'t so bad. Read the book, follow the syllabus, and come to class and you will be fine. His stories are ""quite literally"" legendary!8-)"
"This professor will teach you more than any other professor at CCC. He lectures for the entire class, but they\'re always interesting. If you have an open mind and enjoy critical thinking, this is the guy for you. He will willing to help and clarify anything if needed."
The lectures were actually pointless for this class. MAKE SURE YOU READ THE TEXTBOOK!!! I learned all the stats I know from the textbook not him.
"3D explanations are not her thing but over all easy class. If you do the assignements properly, easy A because her final is basicly questions from the book"
Duma will be a good fit for you if you\'re good at self-teaching. Her midterms/finals are made up of difficult textbook problems and are doable even without consistent class attendance. Would recommend.
"Really good teacher, always tries her best to help and takes all her time to do so. Unlike several other teachers, she explains elaborately and her notes are so beneficial. Would take another class with her if I can. Thank you Ewa Duma!"
She gave me depression.
"I absolutely loved her. Her lectures were interesting and I actually enjoyed going to class. The down side is that there are quite a lot of papers assigned throughout the semester, however she does a good job with feedback in order to improve your grade. I did find that she can be a tough grader but if you put in effort you\'ll do fine. I got an A"
"I really enjoyed her class! I undertood her teaching style, she was clear in her directoins and she helped me become a better writer overall. She does asign a lot of papers but she grades quite easy in my opinion. I would take her again."
"She is not a good professor. Class would be so pointless showing up. Very late at submitting grades. She is SUPER NICE AND FUNNY and class is very CHILL but as a professor she is horrible. Her grading is not clear, she changes things last minute and before you know it, class is cancelled. Don\'t take her if you don\'t have to."
"Worst professor ever! This class was 2 credits, but should\'ve been 4. She gives too much homework & makes you do a group project where you interview other professors & students & she gives too many long papers for this one project, some papers not even related to our project. She is the only teacher that waits until the last day to submit grades."
She\'s very disorganized and unprepared. She never passes back your assignments to show you your grades and she doesn\'t post midterm grades so you basically need to guess how well you\'re doing the whole semester. She made everyone come to class the day before Thanksgiving break just to tell everyone 5 minutes into class that she will cancel it.
"Absolutely horrible professor. Terrible temperament and very unclear about assignments. She makes everything as complicated as possible, seemingly in attempts to trip up students. Very unwilling to help students when confused, and simply has no consideration for anyone other than attractive male students in the class. Avoid her at ALL costs!!!!"
"In my opinion, this class was not difficult at all as long as you actually studied and prepared well for his iClicker quizzes. His test questions are very direct and fair. You don\'t need to buy his textbook, just his lecture book so that you can write notes in it. Yes he does have strict rules, but he\'s very funny and makes lectures entertaining."
"His lectures will either bore you out of your mind or have you laughing every 5 minutes. He\'s quite entertaining and really funny during lectures, however very strict. He has a very strict policy about cell phones or any electronics for that matter, and I suggest not even thinking twice about using it during lectures."
"Go to class, random quizzes for attendances. class is grades by points. No phones. Follow his rules and you will be fine. DONT buy the textbook. His notes are online. test are the notes. He uses clickers. He sends emails thing that you need to read (print them out/fill them out/take to class, they might be for extra credit)"
"I had Dr. Brooks for BSC 1010 and 1011. He is very knowledgeable in what he teaches. On the exams, his word choices are very tricky. So when you\'re studying for the exams, make sure you are very certain in what you\'re studying otherwise the wording could potentially trick you. He gives unannounced quizzes so study before each lecture."
Brooks is not a good professor. He lectures very heavy and if you don\'t pay attention you won\'t pass. Tends to make fun of students and can be funny at times but other times he takes his jokes too far to the point where he is very disrespectful. He will not change the way he teaches the course so don\'t bother taking him for biodiversity
"Very funny during lectures, keeps you engaged for the most part and makes everything easy to understand. Took him for both Bio Principles and Bio DIversity, and glad I did. GO TO THE LECTURES! Everything he says during lecture is fair game for the exams, which are a bit difficult, but if you pay attention and do what he asks you\'ll have no problem."
"Professor Brooks is a character. I had him for both Bio-principals and Biodiversity. Attend every lecture, read the lecture notebook before class and you\'ll do fine. His exams aren\'t too difficult, and in my opinion were pretty direct. His lectures are enjoyable but beware he\'s very strict: no phones, no laptops, no technology whatsoever."
"If you don\'t want to study and I mean really study for the tests do not take him, you will NOT pass. He\'s funny and makes lectures atleast interesting but he is very strict and class is mandatory. (you\'ll want to go anyways, not a class you learn on your own) You will need iclicker for random quizes, that you\'ll need to prestudy for. Solid choice."
"He\'s super intimidating at first and then you see he really tries to make the entire lecture time engaging. Don\'t be late, don\'t talk during his lecture, and TURN OFF ELECTRONICS (for real). Tests are fair, lots of pop quizzes so make sure you read topics ahead of time or you\'ll regret it, and he offers many extra credit opportunities."
"Seems intimidating at first, but just jokes around a lot. He tries his best to make boring topics interesting so you don\'t fall asleep. Read ahead before class because he likes giving pop quizzes, and a lot of the time the same questions come back on exams."
A little rude but if you show up to class you\'ll be fine ohhhh just don\'t be late.
"This legend was the highlight of my first semester. He\'s loud, funny, and likes to pick on his students out of mutual fun. He literally says what\'s going to be on the tests. This class was extremely easy, just occasionally review; I crammed the exams and still got A\'s on all of them. Dr. Frazier is just too boring, just avoid her."
"One of the best professors I\'ve ever had. His lectures are so entertaining that even when mind-numbingly topics like botany present themselves, he manages to grasp your attention. I recommend him to anyone that wants to have an incredibly clear understanding of biology, while laughing the entire time."
This is one of the best professors I have had at this school. His lectures are very straight forward and if you take good notes and study there is no reason you shouldn\'t pass. It is also an added bonus that he is extremely funny and really engages the class. His exams are fair and a lot of times he will hint at questions he will ask during lecture
Brooks has been my favorite professor at FAU so far. I am a Biology major so this class is important to me but he made the class enjoyable even though the tests were rough. Just need to study well and you\'ll do fine.
The GOAT
"Personally loved this class, he\'s low key funny so it\'s not that boring. He tells you exactly whats on the test if you go to class. Don\'t buy or read the textbook buy his little brown book instead. Study his powerpoints and that book and the stuff he says in class and it\'s not that hard. If you don\'t pay attention in class might call you."
"Dr. Brooks is an amazing teacher. I had him for Biodiversity and I learn so much and his lectures were never boring. He actually teaches, yet you have to put on your part to do well in class."
"I took Brooks for BSC1010 as well, same textbook that I never opened. Read the ppts! take notes on what he lectures! Go to classes and study for iclicker quizzes, they are pop quizzes & not scheduled. Exams often have a few freebies but they are very long, study well!"
"Do not buy the workbook. This class is an easy A. Students who don\'t pass are the ones who study the night before. If you can\'t get an A in this course, you are not ready for upper level science courses. also DO NOT BE LATE. NOT EVEN A SECOND (LITERALLY)."
Carol Topping is one of the best professors that I have had. She is very interesting and knows what she is talking about. Just do the work and turn it in on time and you will pass.
"She was so understanding! I tore my ACL and had to miss a ton of class, and I still made it out with an A+"
LOVE her!!! Best teacher at Vol State by far.
I would retake this course a million times !! Tops explains everything very well and is always making us laugh. She is willing to work with you if your grade is struggling (which is unlikely) and is almost always available outside of the classroom.
Topping is an amazing professor. She is full of hilarious stories and will make you laugh every class. She is super kind and easy to talk to. I am taking her courses again this fall.
"Top is a great professor and is incredibly intelligent. Do not underestimate her. She is hilarious and class was always super enjoyable, I actually wanted to go even though I knew it wasn\'t necessarily mandatory. She\'s great, if you have the opportunity to take her, DO!"
I love Professor Topping. Literally the best professor you could ever have. She has plenty of opportunities for you to make good grades and receive the grade you want. With her class you should pass with ease. I just love her y\'all as you can see. I prefer you guys to take her class you won\'t regret it.
"Awesomely easy to understand, she\'s good at making you understand. She says things to grab your attention. She\'s funny, and easy to work with! I would recommend her to anyone!! She my favorite so far.."
One of the best professors at vol state. She is absolutely incredible and truly cares about each of her students. I was actually so sad on the last day of class because I loved her so much. I recommend this class to literally anyone. It will help you tremendously because she has a huge heart and loves her students.
"Prof. Topping is a great instructor who cares about her students and wants them to succeed. Show up, do the work, show interest in the subject, and you\'ll get an A no problem."
Topp truly cares about her students and definitely has a passion for what she teaches. I would recommend her class to everyone!
"Top was absolutely amazing, I would take all of her classes if I had the time and money. She makes college fun and I love her to death."
wonderful professor. Makes class interesting and fun.
Adult humor kind of teacher. Gave you many chances to get things right and turn them in. Easy A.
"She\'s AWESOME! Sad day leaving her class for the last time. She\'s hilarious, keeps you interested, and really wants for every student to pass. There\'s no way anyone should fail her class."
"Dr. Betts is a wonderful teacher. He is always willing to help if you need any clarification on anything. Really knows his stuff. He makes you work for your grade, but he\'s fair and clear on what he\'s looking for."
"I was always so scared of public speaking, but Bob Betts creates a classroom environment that takes away that anxiety. He grades on content, not nervous ticks or memorization. Super enjoyable class with fun assignments. I would recommend to anyone taking a speech class."
Took this last year but he was a very nice professor. He was very helpful and if you do exactly as he instructed and follow his outline then youll be fine. I was very anxious to take a public speaking class but I left the class becoming more confident in public speaking. 10/10 would recommend. Research matters A LOT.
"Best one I have ever had. Speech is hard. You have to practice, regardless of the professor. But if you do what he says, each speech you write he checks on each person individually in class. If you do exactly what he says when he gives you individual help, and you practice, you will pass easy. Hes really smart so just do what he says."
Professor Betts managed to make my first year of speech enjoyable rather than stressful and nerve-racking. He provided you with plenty of notice and instructions before each assigned speech. He also did not require anyone to memorize their speech; his focus is more on content. And participation matters significantly in his class!
"Research is key to good grade. Make sure to show up, be on time, and take notes as best you can. He loves class participation and questions and is very accessible via email and office hours. He didn\'t assign much in textbook, but if you take the time to read the related chapters, you will have a solid advantage."
"Show up, do your research, and you\'ll do well"
"Great teacher, very enthusiastic, and genuinely cares about his students. Great guy. One of my favorite teachers I\'ve had."
"As someone who is downright scared of public speaking, I found his class to be very welcoming and helpful. I learned tons of pointers and figured out how to make my speeches concise and effective. Professor Betts made my four week Summer speech course bearable by being a helpful, friendly guy. He is to-the-point but not harsh. Great guy."
"Mr. Betts is really into helping students become all they are capable of. I\'m a shy person and hate public speaking; he realizes this and grades accordingly. He doesn\'t let you slip by but grades you low enough to push you to progress. I think all it takes to be successful is your own willpower and motivation, not being a good speaker."
"Dr. Karpinski is by far one of the best professors at DePaul University. Every time I left his class, he helped me look at the world from a completely different perspective. He is extremely understanding and is always there to help out. Simply put, every professor should be like him. You will miss out if you don\'t take this class."
Best professor at DePaul. This professor really cares about his students. He gives a couple of essays for the quarter but makes it really easy to pass. Let\'s you redo any assignment until you receive full credit. I enjoyed every minute of this class and it was a night class. So happy I took him.
"Professor Karpinksi is AWESOME! Most amazing person i have ever met. There are two reflection papers one page each, and three 5 papers. He does an amazing job at explaining the material! He give you extra time to complete the papers. TAKE HIM! Best religion teacher EVER! Keep up the great work Professor! Chili pepper approved!"
"Professor K is an angel from above!! He is such an intelligent man. He does assign a lot of papers but it\'s worth it because you actually learn! The readings are interesting and so are his lectures. He engages everyone to participate and keeps an open mind during discussions. Keep up the great work! Here\'s your chili pepper, you deserve it :)"
Overall interesting class. Take if you need to raise your GPA. Pay attention and turn in your assignments. Give effort in this class and you should get a A or B.
I recommend that you read the course description because the title of the course is misleading. The books for the class are necessary. Every assignment is based on the readings. He can come off as a little rude to the skeptics. However he really tries hard to be respectful. Be prepared to hear rambling from the die hard Christians in the class.
"Dr. Karpinski made it clear during his first interaction with the class that he was there for the students. Although it was an easy class, he made sure that the students got the most out of each and every class through participation, great reading material, and discussion."
"Dr. K was awesome! He always kept my interest and made a Thursday night class tolerable, which is really impressive."
"He is a very kind man and is willing to set aside Fridays for ""study groups"" if you are available. His teaching is mediocre, and students correct his problems AT LEAST 3 times a day, so watch out for his work. His tests are medium-challenging and must do homework to understand them. The exam is extremely difficult, so better do good on those tests"
"Terrible teacher. Cannot get a full thought out. Will tell you incorrect information and even if you are correct, will tell you that he is correct. Does not understand electronics and makes you do the class on the computer without any clue as to how to do it. Makes you buy a book for $150 and doesn\'t let you use it."
"Professor Conrad is a very fair grader and certainly wants his students to understand the material. He had multiple study sessions outside of class. There is a lot of out of class work that he assigns, however, it really helps you understand each and every topic."
"I had prof Fenton for algebra. She lectures over everything you need to know, but moves very quickly and if you slow her down she will make you feel dumb for asking a question. If you pay attention, show up for class, and do the homework its an easy A."
I had professor Fenton for College Algebra. She made all the concepts very clear and worked through problems in a very thorough manner. She always makes time for questions and will work with anyone who is having trouble with the material.
"I wouldn\'t recommend this class if you know you are not great at math. She moves really fast. If you slow her down by asking a question, she\'ll make you feel stupid."
"I took Dr. Hardyway\'s online psychology course. He is a tough grader, and you must turn everything in on time! He does not respond to emails right away. However, if you email him, he will answer any questions or concerns you may have. You must participate in discussions or you will fail. This class is very fast paced, but interesting!!!"
I have struggled with this class this semester online. teacher requires you to sign in and respond to posts on 4 different days which kind of defeats the purpose of online classes and working at my schedule. terrible response time on emails. I have been waiting for a response on an assignment for a week now. whole class has same issue.
"He was a very tough grader, but graded very fairly to what you actually knew. I used the textbook quite a lot also to answer his questions. He has certain papers to write that you NEED the textbook for or else you might not get a good grade. But overall, he was a great professor and I am very glad I took him for psychology."
"He is VERY specific on how assignments are completed. Make sure you complete 4 initial discussion posts b4 deadline, retake exam tests-he gives unlimited attempts. You MUST be DETAILED and give essay answers in your OWN words!! Class is not hard, but requires lots of time/effort. Fair/lenient grading, IF you follow directions, and he offered E.C."
no intellectual bullying..i liked this
enjoyed the class. enjoyed the professor wish every one read the material
liked the number of graded assignments
I liked the way she taught we got written and oral credit. It was a lot of worl but it was all well worth it.
Good class. Liked the paper of my work even though it is not criminal justice. Take her
interesting class
"She has experience in the field, so she knows what she is talking about and provides good insight. Has guest speakers. Attendance not mandatory. Will do anything to help you, if you ask."
Only grades in the class are 3 exams. Tests are easy if you take notes and study. Tests are 35 multiple choice. Gives a few extra credit points if you go to class. She shows several movies and has several guest speakers. Great class and great professor. Would absolutely take again! Attendance not mandatory and textbook not needed
challenging class excellent lectures
Lecture slides(riddled with spelling/grammar errors) and YouTube channels are 80% of the material covered in class. Unless the students are engaged she tends to move quickly/clumsily. Clearly knowledgeable in the subject but not the clearest on answering questions and a little hostile in answering questions even though she encourages them.
"She is a so so teacher. She truly cares about the students. Be prepared to learn the majority of the content on your own. I got an A in this class, she is a very easy grader. The people who said she was a tough grader and gave hard exams, are the ones who did not prepare. This is a tough subject, you need to study."
"I took him twice. I felt the difficulty of his class was fair, The exams were short answer and multiple choice. The daily quizzes he gives, do help you papare for the exams. His grading criteria is clearly laid out. If you do the homework, you should be able to pass the class with no issuies."
"I took this class these past 8 weeks in the Fall of 2017 and I thought it was going to consists a lot more work like people were saying. Honestly, I learned a lot from the labs we were assigned and he strongly believes in all students! There is nothing that couldn\'t be possible in this class. I would highly recommend him to anyone! Thanks again!"
Hilarious guy!!!! Must take! This is a GPA booster. I had him as an online class and I was cracking up while reading the study guide! Take him!!
Professor Warwick is the best. I took his online course plus the lab and I actually learned a lot. He explains bio in a way (in his lab book) that normal people can comprehend. I HIGHLY recommend him. If you stay up to task you will get an A. He is VERY understanding and you can email him with suggestions/questions. BEST PROF EVER.
I took his class a few years ago and I really liked him! He seems like a genuinely nice person and he has a really funny sense of humor. I recommend his class!
"50% of our grade participation was given by attending class 10% was awarded for doing in-class readings and small projects, in which he would rarely assign! Quizzes are easy, online, and 20% of our grade. Midterm and final are 20% of the grade & are also online tests you take at home. If you can\'t get an A in this class, you\'re sad. Lol"
"Professor Warwick is amazing. He is funny and SUPER UNDERSTANDING. One time I got an answer wrong on a quiz and I gave him an explanation as to why I chose that specific answer, and he liked my explanation, and said that he would add that point back on. He is eager to help and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND taking his class. Wish I could take his class again."
"Easy class and lab. The lab kit is ridiculously expensive. $60 for a box of basic stuff you can find at home - straw, clothespin, etc. Lab manual is $100, only difference is the lab sheets are different color. Easy A if you just need class for general education requirement."
"Professor Warwick, is wonderful he grades fairly and he doesn\'t round your grade at all so don\'t expect a higher grade. However, I guess my case was different because I had an 89.89% after my final and he just gave me the A even though I didn\'t expect it :). He is very attentive to his email and will always respond in a timely manner!"
"Dr. G is a fun professor who loves sociology and helping students learn to love it as well. He really cares about his job and it shows. I would 100% recommend taking him if you have the chance. We had 3 exams, all online and pretty easy if you do the readings and go to class."
Dr. G is fantastic. He makes you feel validated and respected as a student. He never talks down to anyone. He keeps his lecturing as interesting as possible (it\'s still theory) and tries to engage students in the discussion. You can tell he puts his heart into his work and really wants to connect with the students. Take him!
"Dr. G is hilarious! He likes to tell personal stories which helps you remember the material. The lectures can get long and boring, but that\'s because the class is an hour and a half. There are only three exams total, all of which are online. There are also two projects. The only downfall to this is that you can\'t lose more than 13 points for an A"
"Dr. G is the man! I took this course online over J-term, but he was still very helpful. Read the instructions and do exactly what he is asking for, and it is an easy A."
"There is three exams, all online, and two one page single spaced papers. I didn\'t read the book once or any of the assigned readings and did just fine. You do need to study for the exams, but if you take notes you should be fine. He can get sidetracked and sometimes the lectures aren\'t that engaging."
Dr. Gongaware was a very good professor. His tests are all online and only two one page papers. Lectures can get long and boring but some of the material is interesting. Just do the review guides and you\'ll be fine.
best prof ever
I\'ll take any class if Prakash teaches it.
"If you want to waste an hour of your day or you just need a place to sleep i recommend this class because you\'ll just sit there and listen to her ramble on until you forget the topic of the discussion, she is a nice person and can speak of good topics but at the end of the day you\'ll wonder why you even went to class that day"
"Reynolds is the best. Super sweet, helpful, easy class. Very accommodating to late papers."
"There are 5 essays you have to do throughout the semester. A few grammar tests. Classes finish early (woohoo!) She helps a lot during the process of writing the essay - just make sure you use her help in editing your drafts and what not. Not a tough grader, but you need to submit all essays. Grading is also very clear"
"I actually would take her again because personally, I\'ve enjoyed writing her papers. I\'ve taken her for ENGL 848 and currently, ENGL 100. Your grade is based on five essays and you can\'t skip one at all. The topics were easy so writing the papers were a cakewalk. Instructions for essays were straightforward. Basically, just do all of your work."
Bob Baugher is an amazing teacher. He goes through and explains his lecture. I really enjoy taking his class. Its definitely a good class to take if someone close to you has died.
"My favorite professor at Highline! He cares more about the students actually getting and understanding the information. He gives feedback on all returned papers, and he always has them graded within two days. Really cares about his students."
"I took Dr. Bob\'s class because all of his amazing reviews- and he is now easily my favorite professor I\'ve ever had. He is so knowledgable and this was one of those classes you will never forget. He has the best stories and his lectures are amazing. Tests are a little long (few short answer questions) but as long as you take notes, you\'ll be fine!"
"I enjoyed Dr. Bob a lot since he made his lectures engaging. He also sets up the classroom for you to interact w/other peers. If you need to take this course for credit, I definitely recommend him. Take good notes-it\'ll be all the material you need on exams. Use notecards, go thru the book, and remember key definitions. He gives bonus!!"
Great professor. Cares about his students. As long as you do your work and extra credit you\'ll pass.
"dr bob is the best proffessor i have ever met you have to take his class to believe he touched my heart, he does everything possible for you to pass the class he has extra credit and he is flexible. you will love his class"
"Dr. Bob is the best teacher I have ever had. He is respectable, friendly, funny, and brilliant. On the first day he gives you all of the essential information needed to pass the class, it can feel overwhelming at first but it\'s incredibly helpful. He fulfills his promise of teaching you all there is to know about Human Relations. Highly recommend!"
"Professor Ho\'s lectures are convoluted and w/o structure. She gives nearly no opportunities for student involvement. That said, she is truly passionate about her work and her students and it shows in the lengthy and helpful feedback she gives on the four essays she assigns. The readings are amazing, it\'s just too bad we don\'t get to discuss them."
"Wendy Ho is definitely a professor who cares about her students. She is accessible, approachable, hilarious, passionate and truly a one of a kind professor. She takes the time to get to know her students and is encouraging. Yes, her assigned readings and essays are challenging, but she teaches so much and is a great resource. I loved this class."
"Oh my god this has probably been my worst experience ever as a student. She rambled on and on n on during lectures; about topics just barely related to the material. I tried to take notes, but honestly there was no point. There are wayyy too many readings to stay caught up on and they\'re quite lengthy. Tests are on ALL readings. Not worth it. AVOID"
"You have a LOT of readings every week. The midterms, final, and papers (2) are based on these readings! She repeats what is important in lecture so you can\'t miss it! Participation in discussion is a must for points. GO TO THE TA for help on the 2 papers! It makes a huge difference. I went from a C+ (1st paper) to B+ (2nd) after meeting w/ the TA."
"Personally, I didn\'t enjoy this class. While TAs were very helpful and kind, Professor Ho tended to go on angry rants during lecture. She\'s very passionate, but she would digress from the readings and run out of time educating us on the history. Tests were relatively easy if you did the readings...4 or 5 20 pages readings per week that is."
"She went through whole lectures too fast because her concentrating group was who already studied in high school or worked in Accounting field. I prepared for the first class with reading the first chapter, but it was totally useless.. There were quite a lot of students(8-9) who already know everything and the professor taught them, not us."
"I feel that she really knows what she is talking about, and therefore manages to explain the subjects very well. She is helpful and makes sure that everybody understands the topic, yet one does not feel stressed or pushed."
She is amazing professor! Her explanation is so clear and so easy for understanding so you can forget about math problems that you had before :) Moreover she has warm heart and she is very kind professor
"She\'s a good professor, just very boring. You always seem to get sleepy and just want to sleep all throughout her classes."
"I like this professor. She is clear in the class and willing to help students who do not understand. ACC220 itself is a hard course. You need to pay attention. If you show up every time and ask questions, you will get an ""A""."
Amazing professor that she explain very well and spend whole class time that mean she don\'t want to waste any minute.
"I learned a lot just from talking with her, she\'s very inspirational! She is one of my fave teachers and I recommend her for computer classes. She was super caring and would answer any questions you had. I passed this class with an A, just do the work and you will pass no doubt. I loved her though, she\'s super sweet!"
"Mrs. Herbert is amazing! If you show up to class, pay attention, and do the work, you will at least pass, if not get a great grade. She\'s enjoyable and relational. Fantastic teacher!"
I really enjoyed this class. I took the online version as long as you do the work and really try you can get an A. There is a lot of homework but it is pretty easy you just have to follow the book. One word of advise buy the book from the school. You need a code for this class and if you buy outside the school you still have to pay for it.
She teaches straight from the book but she will go over it in class before you attempt it just in case the book was not clear enough. the actual class and material were easy and she simplified it even more. Great Teacher.
"Easiest class I had last spring semester! Mrs. Herbert is a very inspiring and amazing instructor! She helped me so much and inspired me to keep following my dreams! As long as you listen, show up for class every time, do the work and ask questions, than it\'s an easy A. I received an A+ in this class, I would take her again in a heartbeat!"
"She was a good instructor but really she didn\'t instruct anything. Everything was based off of your textbook and a ""lab website."" I had some issues arrive and she wasn\'t willing to work with me outside of one instance. The only reason I wouldn\'t take another one of her classes is because its not really my thing. I didn\'t take much away from it."
"The class is about Excel,Word,PowerP,&Access. She goes through all, if you know much about functions and querying in these program you will do just fine. She teaches you the basics and then goes very in depth so pay attention. Everything comes from the book so don\'t hesitate to get ahead of the game. Grading is amazing hundreds of points & likeable"
"This class is really easy. You do an in class assignment and then you do the exact same thing in an application. I reccomend this class to everyone. I missed literally 7 points in the whole entire class and the class has like 2970 points. Plus you learn some great things about excel, word, PowerPoint, and access that will help you in live."
My high school football coach could teach better than this man. Attendance is taken through clicker quizzes that have huge effect on grades. He is extremely rude 1 on 1 and belittles students. No formula sheet so good luck memorizing all the equations for the final. I guess studying 20 hrs for the final isn\'t good enough to pass. 50% averages rip:)
"Bakker is rude and condescending, but his class isn\'t too hard. He moves fast and doesn\'t thoroughly explain everything, but the book does and his tests aren\'t overly complicated. He does lots of clicker quizzes which can be stressful at times."
"Martin is very difficult, so if you\'re not taking this for future classes beware. He\'s probably the best out of all 102 profs, but you need to do so many extra practice probs to pass. Study 1 week+ before the test, no matter what. He can be rude, but you need to put it the work. He is the best @ concept/math balance so if you need future chem do it"
"I had him for both 101 and 102. If you\'re taking 101 as an elective or as an engineering major, DO NOT TAKE HIM. If you\'re premed or chemistry related major, power through and you will learn a ton, which helps in later courses. Tests are hard but if you put in the work and do a lot of practice problems it\'s doable."
"Great teacher. Kind of rude at points, but you will definitely know Chemistry by the end. He is hard but fair and makes you work for your grade. You don\'t get formula sheets for the test, but with enough practice they\'re fairly easy to remember. Take this guy if you can!"
"Dr. Bakker is very prepared for lectures and is great about answering questions in class and outside of class. He loves to see his students putting in effort, so go to office hours when you have questions and attend as many recitations as possible (his quizzes there help a lot, too!) Use all extra problems he gives and it will help for the tests."
"A good lecturer, if not a bit arrogant. He\'s the kind of professor you hate to have while you have him, but will be grateful for after you leave him. However, I\'d only recommend his class if you\'re going to being using chemistry in future courses. It was a lot of effort, and very stressful."
"This guy is awful. He insults people in class and makes a fuss if anyone asks him to work a problem. Has clicker questions every class period and only gives half credit to wrong answers, even though it\'s an attendance grade. Tests were ridiculously difficult, and he never curved, even though test averages were in the 50s. Rudest prof I\'ve ever had."
"If you ask a question in class there is a big chance he will condescend to you in front of everyone, and you will never ask another question again. You go through the homework and feel like you will do well just to bomb tests. Part of why the tests are so awful is because he doesn\'t provide any formulas or constants unlike every other professor."
"Dr. Bakker is as good of a chemistry teacher as it gets honestly. He uploads class lectures and does a great job explaining the math side of the class, which is normally where chemistry teachers struggle. Alot of people have dropped or have bad grades but this isnt an easy class but if you put in effort you will do fine. highly recommend"
"Dr. Bakker gets a lot of negative reviews, but I absolutely loved him! He can be a bit condescending if you ask stupid questions, but do the reading and it\'s an easy A. He teaches straight from the textbook, so I recommend reading ahead of time then going to lecture to clear up anything that you\'re confused on."
Take another teacher. He\'ll do problems in class & make sarcastic comments about how much faster he can do them. Tests much harder with trick questions than other sections & u don\'t get to use formula sheet on final. You might learn more in his class but you are unlikely to get in A unless you\'ve had AP chem and grading criteria not clear.
Dr. Bakker is a very tough teacher but he knows what he is talking about and will prepare you well for future classes if you put the work in. All the basics for the tests are in the powerpoints but in order to do well you need to do a lot of practice problems. Definitely don\'t take if you\'re just taking for a science elective.
"Dr. Bakker\'s class was very difficult and not to be taken lightly. During class he tries to be funny, but often goes over as rude and demeaning. He has many times worked a problem out on the board and not explained where he gets the numbers from. He seems like a brilliant man, but not very good at teaching. I wouldn\'t recommend taking him."
"He is very condescending. Drops your lowest test grade. Expects a lot out of his students, and the ones who try come out with an incredible amount of knowledge."
I had Dr. Bakker for both 101 and 102 and it was one of the hardest classes I have ever had to take. He expects a lot and pushes his students to the limit. I hated his class and thought it was very hard but I learned a lot more than other students with other teachers which will and has helped me with other classes.
Gives lectures mostly on concepts and theory with very few example problems and expects you to learn how to do most problems on your own. He does clicker questions for a grade every class. I would not recommend him to anyone who does not have a strong chemistry background. He also gives no equation sheets for exams.
Dr. Baker really cares about his students. The homework in this class was optional and there were 8 tests and that may seem daunting but the tests were not difficult at all if you looked at the material and/or did the homework. This class could have been very hard but Dr. B went out of his way to make it easier for us while we still learned a lot.
This class is more of an informative class for your future in the aerospace program while learning about basic fundamentals. Dr. Baker cares a lot about everyone in the department and tries to assure everyone is set up for success in this class and in their future in the AEM curriculum.
Dr. Baker is a great professor. AEM 121 was super easy compared to what I\'ve heard about the other engineering intro courses.
"Dr. Baker is a nice person. I did not like this class however due to being graded by few things. Some of which these things were out of the student\'s control. For instance, the egg drop or glider project either worked or it didn\'t work and your grade depended on it. We didn\'t know our egg was going to break and our grade suffered. No tests."
"Amazing class. Entertaining and knowledgeable, plus he\'s more than willing to accommodate changes in schedule. Show up and you\'ll have to try to fail"
Great guy. Great Class. The schedule said this class met 3 times a week but he made it to only twice a week. Baker made class enjoyable even though it was a 9am. Definitely an easy A.
"Good prof and a funny guy. His lectures can run a bit long, but his sense of humor and tangents keeps them interesting. 99% of what you do in class translates exactly to the tests. He also makes accommodations for the way the online HW works, so getting the grade there isn\'t too hard. Just makes sure you don\'t underestimate his tests and do well."
Great teacher doesnt make the class a living hell and the tests are very fair
He\'s a great guy but its hard to learn thermo from him. Goes off on too many tangents. Figured out after the 1st test that I could not go to class and still make the same grades. Im sure going to class would\'ve helped a little more but you\'re just as fine studying old tests. You get a note sheet every test. 4 tests with lowest dropped and a final.
He is the head of ME department. He has been teaching thermo for years. His lectures can be dull and put you to sleep. He goes off topic a lot with his stories. Homework is not due till end of semester but keep up to do well on tests. The redeeming value is his tests are easy and curves very generously.
"Rambles a lot. He takes up half of the class going on his ""Midkiff diversions."" We\'re paying money to get an education, not listen to stories. His in-class examples are nothing like the test questions and the homework problems are unnecessarily hard. If you get above a 60, he counts them as a 100 because ""the program messes up."" The book sucks too."
"I loved Midkiff as a person, he was hilarious and told awesome stories a lot, but sometimes his lectures were boring or there were things on the exams that we didn\'t ever go over. All of the homework is due at the end of the semester, but keep up with it because it helps on the exams. Most of the homework was way harder than the exams though."
"Pretty easy class. A lot of the math-based problems are just plug and chug. Be careful with the conceptual stuff. Look at the notes he puts online, pay attention in class, do the homework, and you\'ll be just fine"
"Homework due before every class, but it\'s only 3 questions. I would do the homework and not Chegg it because it\'ll help when you\'re preparing for the tests. Tests are similar to homework problems and the final was EXACTLY our homework problems."
Key points: 1. Mostly Vectors and Vector applications. 2. All tests were easy for anyone with a clear understanding of Cal 2. 3. Final was extremely hard. 4. Magical Curves? I went into the final needing to make a 100 to make a solid B. I did terrible on the final. Ended with an A-. 5. Great Teacher. 6. Short Homework due every lecture.
"He\'s a little difficult to understand, but I took this class at 8am. He focused more on computation than conceptual questions, but does a great job at explaining both."
"Not a great lecturer, just does a few examples with little context or general formulas. Tests are moderately difficult and he is very stingy with partial credit. No dropping grades or anything like that. Homework is very time consuming, and small errors hurt your grade. Would not recommend if you aren\'t very good at physics."
"Clear, straightforward, understandable. Teaches all necessary material well and prepares you for tests. Hand-written short homework daily, I would suggest doing them for practice. Gives a couple tests but they are short and fair and he tells you what type of problems will be on them. I would definitely recommend Dr Haque."
"Haque is an exceptional professor. His communication is shaky at times, but you\'ll get used to it. Test questions are very similar to the homework. He gives a couple good examples in lecture, but usually gets rushed toward the end of class. If you pay attention in class and do the homework it\'s not too bad."
Not the best in lecture. Be sure to pay attention during his review classes before exams as they always give the exact problem types that will be on exams. Typically curves the overall grade at the end of the semester as most students do poorly.
"Do not take Sharif for Dynamics, or anything for that matter. He stands up at the front working examples, with horrible handwriting, and speaks incomprehensibly. To make it worse, he uses online tests and quizzes with ridiculously low tolerances, and made us write down work but didn\'t give partial credit for it, would just TAKE OFF points..."
"I didn\'t listen when I was told not to take Sharif for Dynamics, and I wish I hadn\'t taken his class. The material isn\'t difficult, but he only uses online grading and it makes it really hard to do well in the class even if you understand the material. He also has a really thick accent and bad handwriting, lectures are difficult to understand."
"Professor Sharif is unintelligible. His accent is atrocious, and he speaks as though he has a mouth full of marbles, and his handwriting is somehow worse. He writes both his ""v\'s and r\'s"" as you would a gamma, which come up a lot in dynamics. He isn\'t capable of doing his own problems in class, and made the 2nd test the day after the drop date."
Professor Sharif teaches fluids in a very straightforward way. He holds review sessions before exams that are very similar to the exam itself. Homework is due every class but is only worth 5% of the final grade so doesn\'t hurt too much if you forget a few assignments. If you study the review and homework problems before the tests you should be fine
I cannot understand what he is saying. His notes are very messy and his handwriting is horrible. His tests are similar to the homework but he is not good at explaining anything. I had him for Fluids and Dynamics and both times were MISERABLE. Do NOT take him for anything!!!!!!!!!
"Dr. Sharif comes to class with problems to work out. These problems are almost identical to the online homework. However, he often makes mistakes/gets confused with his own work. This can make the class confusing. His tests are very similar to the homework. Make sure you actually know how to do the homework and not just copy it from your notes."
"Don\'t take him if you plan on taking Dynamics. He is supposed to be pretty good with Fluid Mechanics, but he wasn\'t very comfortable teaching Dynamics."
"His accent is difficult to understand and it\'s not helped by his incredible messy handwriting. You\'ll have to teach yourself the material out of the book. He\'s also very condescending to anyone who asks a question. He gives a lot of homework, but it\'s not too tricky. His tests are almost always just like his review questions, which is nice."
"I find Dr. Sharif very difficult to understand. His accent is thick, his handwriting is messy, and his lecture notes are unorganizated. He\'s a lecturer that works examples without telling you what your solving for, what topic you\'re on, etc. He also wastes a lot of class time waiting for the class to participate when no one knows the answer."
"Professor Sharif is not the professor to take dynamics with. We spend class going over future homework examples. While this may seem nice, our homework did not relate to the first exam. Also, when a student asks him a question in class he simply repeats what he has said before which is not helpful. I would not recommend him for dynamics."
I loved this class. Dr. Sharif has an accent which takes a few days to get used to but he has an amazing teaching style. The majority of lecture is him working out problems by hand. Before each test he does a review of 3 questions which are EXTREMELY similar to the actual test questions. He gives tons of partial credit and always wants to help.
Professor Hu lectures in an understanding matter; writes all the steps to the problem. Daily homework that is optional. It is to your benefit to do the homework. Three quizzes per week and the problems are from the homework. Fair and easy grading system. Recommended to do the homework. Tells you what is on the test and is similar to the homework
"No exaggeration when I say Mr Hu is one of the best teachers I\'ve had. Calc3 is not easy and it covers many topics, yet I was able to work the hw based almost entirely on what I learned in lecture. He\'s engaging, caring, hilarious, and approachable. He makes himself available outside of class and is responsive to email/phone. He is rooting for you"
Took Mr. Hu\'s summer school course. He was awesome! Explains everything in detail. He is well organized and goes over things that way you definitely absorb the information. I would take him again!
"Has a very thick accent, but all his notes and examples he puts on the board are clear and straight forward. Very useful for Math 60. Daily lectures help tremendously with the HW. DO the HW to help pass the quiz the next day. Quizzes are daily. He will go over anything people have trouble with. Grades on a curve."
"Great teacher in CCSF. He\'s very funny, and his logic is very clear. This teacher really get you ready for math 110B and math 110C."
"Mr Hu would take time to explain the more subtle points of Calculus I. I was repeating this class for the third time with respectable grades previously. Mr Hu would make jokes about ""stupid math majors"". And the sci fi show Dr Who. Mr Hu had class study groups prior to tests/finals. I wish I had better study skills to retain learning I will review"
"Mr. Hu is a very nice guy, but he\'s also one of the most difficult math professors I\'ve ever had. I struggled to earn a C, but Hu is very well organized and you can learn a lot from his lectures. Not recommended for the faint of heart but if you identify as a math geek and like a challenge then this is the guy for you."
"Paul was a nice guy, but he was a ridiculously hard grader. He had no grace with any grades. Over the top and should not be teaching. He is too smart to be teaching college kids. If you dont talk in class you dont get any participation points. I would NEVER take him again. Im telling you, SAVE YOUR SELF!!"
nice guys AWFUL teacher. just writes unintelligible graphs on the board and expects you to know what he is talking about. didn\'t even use the book at all. only has tests and a 5% quiz and a 35% cumulative final. this guy is way too smart to teach people who aren\'t econ geniuses. would take a different professor.
Not a bad choice for EC 110. He has dry humor. I made an A- in his class and studied a day or two before the test. I\'m not very smart either.
by far worst I\'ve ever had. UA should fire him today. I am a straight A student who got my first C because he was such a bad professor.
"Dr. Pecorino is incredibly smart - there\'s no denying that. However, often times he forgets that he is teaching college students. do the study guides and you\'ll be fine for the tests. Go to lecture and MAKE him explain. The final however was awful. I scored above a 90 on every test and barely got a 68 on the CUMULATIVE final (35% of your grade)."
By far the worst teacher at UA. AVOID
"Hardest undergrad class I\'ve had in my ec major. Exams are really hard. Would probably be easier if he gave you the tools you need. Your studying tools are 1 to 2 examples of the question which he will change drastically. You need to memorize the textbook, his slides, his lectures and google all the info he doesn\'t give you if you want an A. Avoid."
"Pecorino makes EC 430 the hardest class at UA. Do not take him for this course! Half of the class dropped before Halloween, and the other half mostly has Cs. My advisor said this is possibly hardest class at UA taught by one of the worst teachers here. DO NOT TAKE"
"Dr. Pecorino is one of the worst professors at UA. I am a straight A student, and I think he makes class as hard as he can. I do not recommend his EC 430 if you have another elective you can take."
Fantastic Professor. Easy to understand and always lets lecture out early. Never assigns homework or quizzes so all your grades come from tests. Such a great teacher that you\'re always prepared for the test.
"There is a lot of extra credit and he is very fair in the grading criteria. He is super sweet. If you show up to every class, you get four points on your final average. Would take him again!"
"She\'s seems like a caring lady but her teaching methods are awful. She doesn\'t except late work, even with a doctor\'s note, does not reply to emails, and is difficult to speak to. I constantly felt like I was being judged by her when I participated in class, because she is very opinionated. I have all As except this class. STAY AWAY."
"She opens your eyes to Asian American women issues, but make sure to do your outlines asap! There is few hw and barely any quizzes, so try to work hard on them. Midterm and final were essays, she\'s a tough grader but you just need to understand and write in her pov. Visit her during office hours and sit in different parts of the classroom, trust me"
"Do Not take this professor. She is not specific on anything. She is NOT organized at all which causes you to be confused most of the time. She is a tough grader and only wants you to believe what she believes. Thanks to her bad organization skills, I now have four assignments due in one week as finals are approaching. Do Not take her."
The class was not useful at all. The most important thing is that this professor is fake and do not respect the students. Don\'t take her class.
"Take this class if you\'re genuinely passionate about Asian American history. A lot of the people that didn\'t like her, weren\'t really interested in the content. She\'s very vague when it comes to assignments. There\'s a midterm, a final, and some outside work. But as long as you put that you deserve an A on the self evaluations, you\'ll get an A."
Beneski is very monotone and the lectures are dry. You need to go to class and take good notes because he goes into much more detail just off the top of his head. In order to get a good grade you have to be able to apply the material in the test. Start to prepare for the test 2 weeks in advance. Its doable.
"he makes bio so hard to understand. Very smart but doesn\'t know how to make the material easy to understand at all. I studied incredibly hard for his exams, worked with friends, etc. and failed all exams. There are 4 exams all worth 100 points. He crams 5/6 weeks work of material into one Exam. you will be lost with him as your teacher."
WORST PROFESSOR AT WCU! I have never had such a rude & uncaring professor. His lectures do little to prepare you for the exam and his power points are confusing and have slim to none useful info on them. I am pretty sure he is glad that his class is close to impossible. Not sure why he\'s a professor because it seems like he hates students & his job
"The material is extremely dull, but he really makes you remember that it is dull. He tries to confuse you, but you just need to write down every single thing he says. If you attend every class and take notes, you will pass. I studied a lot from the terms of words and it helped a ton even though his last two tests seemed foreign."
"He really knows what hes talking about but he isn\'t the best teacher. Lectures are very monotone and the only grades are exams and 2 homework\'s a month. He doesn\'t tell you about any deadlines, you are just expected to know when the tests are and when the homework\'s are due. His class does not co-inside with the lab at all!!"
"Interesting material but Beneski is really dry. He has a few good jokes, but the material is just so hard and it is hard to focus. Anatomy will take up your life so be prepared to study hard. It is doable."
"Beneski is a very smart man and really knows his stuff about anatomy, but he is not the best at teaching it. He lectures very monotone and it can be hard to keep up with so I recommend recording the lectures because you need to know literally every little detail for the exams. You need to put at least 10 hours in a week if you want a good grade."
Dr. Beneski has a pretty monotoned voice but he knows his stuff. His lectures are dry and can be ridiculously boring but going is essential and worth it. It is a hard course but it is totally doable. Flash cards will be your lifesaver.
"Tests are extremely difficult, definitely go to lecture and read the textbook"
"Beneski is an intellegent man , he knows what he is talking about but is an awful professor. He has no idea on how to relay the message. Anatomy is a comprehensive class in which you have to take a 50 question test in 50 minutes, its absoutley obsurd. I got roofied one weekend and he wouldn\'t let me re-take a quiz, I had my hospital records also."
"Some people are not used to the terminology, so that can get confusing if you don\'t already have prior knowledge about anatomy. The two most important things are: attending lecture and taking really good notes. His tests are all based off of what he says, so re-read your notes to understand thoroughly."
Omg. BEST TEACHER IN NORTH SEATTLE COLLEGE. I wish every teacher would be like Rick!
"Amazing and funny lectures, has a very honest view of American Government which I enjoy. His quizzes and papers are super easy, I literally read / learned nothing and still got a 4.0. Make sure you turn stuff in, because if not he might not get back to you to turn in late work. Also, assignments are due at 5:00 PM, not 11:59!"
"Rick is a wonderful professor--engaging, intellectual, and intelligent. He is passionate about political science and how it affects daily life. Lectures can be dramatic, amusing, and poignant. Although you probably won\'t need to take notes (work is minimal), I ended up writing down many inspirational things he said. Awesome class and teacher!"
Not helpful at all. He left on two trips during the semester and did not care at all. Study edge and his class notes barely helped either.
"Talham went to chemistry seminars around the world, in his absence the TA would take over the course. The TA sucked at lecturing. Talhams lectures are very interesting though. He doesn\'t use power points. I finished with an 83, which is an A. One Important thing; Use Study Edge as supplement if you wish, not as a learning tool. Understand the notes"
he is a great professor and seems very cool
"Talham is a great guy, but thinks we are geniuses. He made the final very hard but because the average was pretty low, he changed the grade scale to help us out a bit, I had an 82 which was an A- in his class, so yes its hard but the scale makes up for it. I studied so hard for each exam but every exam was very difficult, and he covered more topics"
"Dr. Talham was a great lecturer, and very kind. Unfortunately, he hasn\'t taught for 10+ years, so none of his practice exams were up-to-date. He assigns lots of optional reading and h/w problems, but you don\'t have to do them if you use Study Edge. Being horrible at chemistry, SE saved my grade w/their awesome review sessions and practice problems."
"Avoid Talham at all costs,he is an extremely uninvolved professor. I believe that he does care about chemistry and teaching, however, he has not displayed that this semester. His exams had nit-picky details and he went at a considerably faster pace than all the other teachers for this course. The only practice exams provided were over 10 years old"
I would never take Dr. Talham again. Was out of town the two weeks before out first exam and the week before finals. Tests are very hard and he gives practice exams from 1993 and 2000 which are not helpful. Would recommend anyone else. Yeah hes a nice guy but thats about it. Would not recommend.
"Very knowledgeable teacher. His tests are not easy, but they are only of material covered in class and nothing new or tricky. Knows the answer to all questions and is very nice and respectful. Can get an A, but you must work for it and study for the test a day or two in advanced. Fair teacher and very good balance of material learned vs. difficulty"
He is a super nice guy and want the best for his class. That being said if you go to his Office hours he turns into a mean person and kinda judges you. But other than that he was awesome and would def recommend him.
Defiantly the best professor I\'ve had for GEN chem. But the class is still hard. I got an A using Study Edge. They really help to explain and emphasize the most important things Talham goes over. 100% recommend going to the weekly review sessions with Study edge made a huge difference when it came to the exams.
"Professor Talham is the best! He\'s a cool guy who knows how to make Chemistry interesting, and a hard class accessible to students. He presents the subject matter in a clear and concise manner and even hand writes the notes along with his students, so you never miss anything because the professor is going too fast. Would take again!"
"I loved his lecture style! It\'s frustrating when professors put up slides and expect you to just copy them down while talking fast. Dr. Talham put slides up AND wrote items down on the board AND explained as he went. Lots of great visual aids in class. He made a note to learn every student\'s name in class during Summer A. Kind guy, great lecturer"
"It was VERY difficult to earn a good grade. She will write on the board notes that are verbatim to the book and won\'t explain it well at all (if she can, she sometimes refers to students for answers). The programs had me sitting in tutoring for hours on end. The review guides given are decent but very vague, overall avoid this prof if possible."
"She knows her stuff and is very helpful. CS lectures can be boring, so no surprise there. Learned a lot, but I wouldn\'t take her unless you are a major. Overall very personable and sweet! Would take again"
"Very ill prepared and scattered professor. Very often goes off on tangents that don\'t relate to the class. She does not explain even basic concepts in a way that everyone can understand, and instead writes definitions followed by a poor example. If you don\'t understand after that you\'re sol. First test had various students with grades below a 10%"
"I\'ve had her for two semesters now. Her lectures consist of showing us various definitions and examples, but not really explaining them. I had to learn most things by religiously examining the textbook and watching videos online. Going to class always felt like a waste of time., but it\'s required. Expect to be confused every class period."
"She doesn\'t really ""teach"" us. She ""shows"" us things. She doesn\'t explain how to use them in certain situations which makes her a poor professor. And she takes great joy in making the tests abnormally difficult."
"The professor is a nightmare. I understand that the professor is merely to show you a path, then you go upon a journey to learn. But when that professor only gives you a hammer and some nails and expects you to build the titanic, that\'s when I can\'t respect her. TLDR: She gives you basics, but doesn\'t help you with anything else. Suicide For Grade"
"Possibly the worse teacher I\'ve ever had. Her lectures were scattered and confusing and often we ended up off topic. This class claims ""no prior programming experience"" however this did not feel like the case considering I felt constantly lost despite reading the book and never missing class. Not good for beginning programmers."
"She is a tough grader. Tough to the point of being borderline unfair. Each project is 100% correct or 100% wrong. If you had an error, no matter how small, you would get a zero. Luckily, she lets you retry the homework you turned in, for a slightly reduced point total. Which you will do a lot."
"She\'s not as bad as many students on here say she is. She lets you know exactly what is going to be in the tests in her study guides. She covers the important topics in class. I had a bit of knowledge in CS before taking this class, but the class would be just fine for someone who has no background in CS."
"Although I\'m not receiving a bad grade at the moment, I cannot deny that she is not the greatest of teachers. She skips over some things in class and her assignments occasionally will cover things she did not discuss. Make sure you go over her review guides and do the reading and the homework, otherwise you\'ll probably fail. Go to the tutors 1st."
She\'s fine. She straight up tells you that she takes pleasure in making questions so hard that people will get them wrong.
I think it says something that the positive reviews all have negative user reviews whilst negative reviews have positive user reviews. This professor is just awful. Stay away from this class. I recieved an A so I am not just complaining. Her teaching style is godawful. Many people drop out of the major cause of her. Awful role model.
"If everyone is quiet when she asks questions, there will be a surprise quiz. Read even if you don\'t understand because, if you ask questions, she will keep explaining in differnet ways until you get it. Do not skip the review day before a test. If you don\'t do well, go to office hours and ask questions. She\'s nice if she sees you trying."
"Feedback was good, though I had to have ""tracking changes"" in Word explained to me. Pretty good for an online class. Lots of reading, but I expected that because of the subject. I always got a fast response to my questions."
"I have anxiety issues, and I was afraid of online classes. Ms. Sailors gave me her phone number and let me text/call with issues during regular workday hours. This helped me succeed in my very first online class. There is a lot of reading, but I found the book helpful and informative. I believe i learned a great deal in this class."
Very good teacher. He\'s soft spoken but takes amazing notes. He is the best drawer ever for a math instructor. His test are exactly like the old ones that he gives out and he gives bonus on every test!
He has a thick accent and gives a lot of homework. Class was very challenging
Dr. Vo is the sweetest old man! His lectures can be a little dull at times but they are incredibly informative and are indicative what his tests will be like. Gives study guides and practice tests for all tests including the final!
He was a really sweet and nice guy. Homework is really tough.
"I have him for Cal II, his tests are easy and always give 5 extra point for every test. Would take him again."
"calc 3 with him at first it was hard to understand him trust me you get used to his accent, give both online hw and hw he made up. test is heavily based off the problems he made so if you can solve them quick you\'ll Ace his class"
I have him for Calculus III. He would give 5 extra points on any tests and expected HW every Monday. His accent will get better when you are used to it and try to sit at the front. Very lenient on partial credits. He is quite funny sometime.
"Had for Calculus III. Sometimes can be difficult to understand, but if you sit towards the front you should get it. If I saw his name listed for another math course, I would take him again in a heartbeat"
"He was pretty clear to understand, and WANTED everyone to succeed. He posted last years tests and answers in order to help us review. Even though he gave some of the hardest webassign homework the tests were cake walks. Not even kidding; he built 5 points into each test and was huge on partial credit. Made Calc 3 a breeze."
"After repeatidly taking this course, I took this professor in the summer & got an A. He lectures from the moment class starts to a little over the class end time. To take notes I used my macbook and found it much easier to follow his layout! FOLLOW HIS LAYOUT & Study his notes in the layout he gives 6 hrs a day, his test come straight from notes!"
"Great professor! His notes are very clear and organized. If you study and understand the notes, you will be perfectly fine! He gives lots of examples and is super interesting. He makes biology fun and helped me want to learn. He wont give your grade away.\'you have to earn it, but he is fair! Take him! He\'s always available for help and he cares!"
Dr. Nicoletto is a wonderful professor. However the exams and material can be very hard. Do not except the class to get handed to you. You need to at least study 5-6 hrs a day if not more. I recommend taking this class in the summer because the grades are better and the material is fresh on your mind.
"Dr. Nicoletto is an amazing professor! I highly recommend him, and would take him again. He is inspirational, and is always available to help. You do have to show up to class because his tests are all from his lecture. He posts PP\'s on BB with illustrations, but he doesn\'t post his notes. Must study daily, but thats with any science class."
"This is the best and by far the most inspirational professor I have ever had the pleasure to take. If you truly care about science you will love this class and this professor. If you don\'t care and think it is ridiculous that a professor makes you study, after taking this class you will either shape up or probably drop out of college. Best ever!"
"Very nice professor that offers LOTS of extra credit, even free points on tests (ie. ""just mark A""). If you\'re struggling, which shouldn\'t happen much, she is very accessible for office hours and gets back to you frequently on emails. Topics are also interesting and easy to learn also it\'s just music and learning to appreciate it. Fantastic class"
Super easy class for nonmusic majors. Definitely have to put effort into studying for exams if you want a good grade but there are a lot of easy points in the class to boost your grade if you don\'t do well on the exams. Tons of extra credit points (I went into the final exam with over 100% in the class). Online HW due before class is easy.
"Susan is a great professor and offers a ton of extra credit. It is extremely hard to not get above an A- in this class. No attendance is taken, however, there are 12 quizzes throughout the semester. Most of the time you can use your notes, she provides you the answer, or gives you points for trying. This is a very easy class for a UP."
"Pay attention in class or get notes from a friend and you\'ll do fine. There are in class quizzes at the end, but you can use notes. 3 tests, 2 concerts and 1 project all easy to get A\'s on. She is helpful if you email her or talk to her after class. Boring class, but super easy A."
"Lindahl was a great professor to have for this class. You are required to go to 2 concerts for the class throughout the semester, but less than other mus114 professors. If you keep up on the online quizzes (you can always get 100%) and do the extra credit youll be totally fine. She really wanted her students to succeed and is very helpful!"
"She isn\'t the most sympathetic professor, but it is so easy to pass the class. She offers so much extra credit and you can take the quizzes until you get 100% on them. Show up to class though because there are little in-class responses that add up to 150 points throughout the semester. You have to attend 2 concerts and write about them. Overall OK."
"Organized professor, very nice lady, and very understanding. Easy A if you attend class and put forth the effort. Learned a lot I have never known before. Would recommend if you were to take the class."
"Great class. All you have to do is show up and pay attention (make sure you get the right notecards). I went to a performing arts school in middle school so I already knew most of the things but she does explain things really well and she is willing to help if you dont. The class was with about 200 other kids so go to her office hours, if need be."
"Dr. Lindahl is great! I am not majoring in anything music-related, but took this class because I heard it was an easier WI. She doesn\'t even give that many writing assignments, and the ones that she does assign are easy. The homework is really simple and the exams aren\'t too bad either. Go to class because she does in-class assignments sometimes."
"As I\'m sure for many who are reading this I am not in the music program nor am I an expert even after this course. But it was a really easy to pass course, professor Lindahl offers a ton of extra credit and you can\'t not get a 100% on the online homework and quizzes. If you need a music class for graduation this is the way to go."
"Although I don\'t understand music nor have I ever taken a music class, she made things very simple. The only way you wouldn\'t pass this class is if you didn\'t do any of the work. If you put in the effort, regardless of your test grades, you WILL pass with an A"
"Professor Lindahl is a great professor, who does a good job at explaining the idea of music to non music majors. She gives you guided notes, and if you pay attention you will do good on the exam. She offers lots of extra credit, and gives you ample time to complete assignments."
"Professor Lindahl was an awesome professor. She is very passionate about music, and it makes it easy to put in the effort. If she can tell you are trying you will get a good grade. Attendance is highly recommended."
"Susan was a great professor. She gave many extra credit opportunities, and allowed everyone to pass with at least an A if effort was put in. Showing up to class is not mandatory, but is very helpful in order to receive a high grade. She is very passionate about music, but is also respectful to those that aren\'t."
I really liked her! She was very respectful to students and understood that not everyone would learn at the same pace. Very organized!!!! Loved the online quizzes that you could take until you reached 100%. Lots of Extra Credit opportunities. She really cared about music and teaching music to students who probably have never studied it yet.
"Dr. Boucher seems to be a nice person that wants his students to do well, however, he expects a great load of work and participation in class. As an incoming freshman I managed to do pretty well in all of my other classes except this one. It felt like more of a philosophy class that was set up for failure rather than a normal history class."
"Dr Boucher is super personable and nice. His history lectures are interesting, even thoough I\'m not a huge fan of European history. He\'s really funny as well. You definitely need to read the books he assigns as you have quizzes on them, but for the most part there\'s not much quizzing on stuff he posts online unless he talks about it in class."
"Love this guy. The American West is a very interesting course however. His class is solely based on readings and discussion. Make sure you read read read, and you will do fine."
Awesome dude! I got a decent grade even though I skipped a bunch. Tough grader but hot accent. 8/10 would recommend! ;)
Tough grade. Do well on tests
"Great teacher, and is straight foward. I have had several math professors at parkland. And he is the best i have had! Good amounts of homework, but not strenous. Quizzes and tests are very clear, and are similar to what YOU ARE ACTUALLY STUDYING IN CLASS!!!"
"Tried taking this class online, dropped after the first Exam that I Flunked. Never answered emails for help, told me to go to tutoring center for help, I took online since I am a working adult and couldn\'t take on-campus course. Never felt like could keep up with the online program and work. I am an A student, but was going to flunk if didn\'t drop"
"Jay is a straight forward professor. He teaches for concepts not for memorization, which is helpful. He is funny and occasionally takes the day to just talk politics with his class and get to know students. There are frequent quizzes but they cover literally exactly what he taught in class. Exams are predictable if you go to class and do the work."
good teacher
"He is probably the funniest teacher ever. Does a great job explaining concepts, but doesn\'t take too well to questions. He has a low tolerance for self-explanatory questions because he expects highly from people in Calc II, but it is definitely worth taking. Especially from Jay Ko."
"Jay Ko told us one the first day of class, if you can\'t pass this class with me you shouldn\'t be taking it. He give you all quiz answers in the lecture and the test are comprised of the quizzes."
Jay is a great teacher and is very clear in his description of Calculus II concepts. He is extremely funny and always engaging during class. He\'s the perfect balance of a teacher who actually does an effective job of explaining material and making class enjoyable.
"MUST TAKE !! do hw , lecture examples, extra problems, and your golden"
"Iv taken two online classes with Thom, and have nothing but success in both of these classes! He is very understanding and flexibility on late work. Although I was in condensed classes over the summer, I didn\'t feel rushed."
"I have taken 2 classes with him. Awsome teacher! Makes class fun, and different than others! Gives you plenty of time to work on papers. Papers are not long, but detailed. Follow directions to a T."
"I have taken classes with him before, but not online and loved it. His on-line course is disorganized and extremely difficult to follow. Took class in the fall and he still had the schedule up for spring. Lack of communication and very difficult to contact."
Excellent professor! This is the second course that I took with Professor Schnarre (intentionally) Very fair and keeps you entertained.
"If you pay attention, turn work in on time and follow his instructions you will breeze by. He as a wonderful professor and keeps class entertaining."
"He\'s very specific on his grading material and really goes into depth on what should be included in your papers to make page count and write good content. He\'s very approachable and has a lively attitude, loves his job. Only down side is he doesn\'t critique papers at all if you\'re already a good writer. Easy class and great prof overall."
"Get ready to step outside your comfort zone and open your mind to learn new ways of seeing things. He allows you to test out ideas and theories through writing. If you are a good writer on top of that, you will ace the class and enjoy it immensely. However, the minute you close your mind is the minute you have set yourself up to fail this class."
"The WORST professor I have ever had. Arrogant, and disrespectful to students. Have a question? Don\'t bother asking, she will tell you to just rewatch her video lesson. Her quiz questions feel like she\'s just trying to trick you and make you second guess yourself. Organization of assignments in blackboard; yeah forget that. AVOID HER IF POSSIBLE!"
AWFUL
Very Rude. Treats you like a child because she thinks grad students are superior. Class isnt that hard but take another professor if possible.
"This class about killed me. Seriously, this was an online class and there was no routine, she refused to answer questions, and she always tried to confuse students on the quizzes. You can listen to the lectures 20 times, do all the practice problems correctly, then get to the test and be like what the crap is she talking about."
"This is a hard class. I don\'t know that I could\'ve done as well with a different type of instructor. Dr. Mills\' lectures are clear and easy to understand, she gives you tons of practice problems that are similar to the graded quizzes and assignments. Don\'t get overwhelmed, take it week by week. Watch the lectures and do the work. Proud of my A!"
"After I read these reviews I didn\'t want to like this class. But one smile at me the first day and he got me. Yeah, he knows he\'s a campus Rock Star. But it only adds to his charm. The man just loves his job. Never in a bad mood. Passionate and brilliant. Every class is a show. And you\'ll learn alot. Sit in front for the best view. :)"
Class was fun but I didn\'t go. I didn\'t read or do anything. I was going to withdraw midterm but he told me if I committed hard to class he would help me with the work and maybe I could pass on a D. Worked my butt off and got a B at the end. Really really good guy because he cares about students and helps so much. Best professor ever.
"Dr. Rahimzadeh is intimidating at first and yes, he\'s arrogant. But he has every right to be. He has such a strong grasp of early English literature and his lectures immediately pull you in. Brilliant and passionate and very funny. After a few weeks you realize he\'s so sweet too. And his clothes are cuter than anybody else\'s in class. A plus."
"Totally adorable. He\'s this weird combination of super shy and super aggressive at the same time. Everything you want from a professor, crazy smart and always entertaining. Listen to lectures carefully because every sentence he says is hilarious. Every single one. And like he says, do the reading, come to class, take notes, go home with the A."
"If you have the chance to take him, DO IT! He will make you work for your grade, but if you put in the effort, he is willing to give you as much help as you need. He seriously is amazing!!"
"Dr. Rahimzadeh is brilliant and he knows it. Which can be very annoying. He\'s been everywhere, he\'s read everything, and he thinks he\'s right about everything. But he\'s also the nicest, most supportive, funniest professor I\'ve had at Eastern. And yes he\'s nice to look at. If you don\'t take his class you are missing out on a key EKU experience."
"Monica is by far the worst employee at UVic. She is rude, unclear, and makes these labs as hard as she possibly can. I get why, it\'s to ""weed out"" the weak students who shouldn\'t be furthering their degree in Chemistry, but she makes it miserable to want to pursue, even if a student is capable enough. I received an A in 101, and am taking 102."
"Monica in person outside of class she can be nice. In class another story. She is very rude, unreasonable, and she gives you the run around like she can\'t be bothered. If you have to take chem I suggest you take it at Camosun and transfer the credits. I have had to go over her head many times for my lab to be graded again for a proper mark."
I agree that there are too many formal lab papers give this is just the laboratory component of one five courses that any student is dealing with
"I would recommend considering applying to UBC instead of UVic,. Their courses are much more balanced than Uvic which is more technical .. like a trades program."
She marks hard but consistent. When I asked for feedback on a grade I found harsh she willingly set up a meeting and explain where I lost points and how I could improve. My lab marks significantly increased following this meeting. I found her very helpful if questions were well thought out and relevant.
Not a good program at all too much busy work
"My first ever TA at university. She really goes hard on you, ESPECIALLY on safety, but it\'s because this is your first chemistry lab and if you don\'t get it down now, you\'ll get hurt later on and she does not want that AT ALL. Nice sometimes... sometimes not, really hit or miss. Switch if you can. Future labs will be better if you continue chem"
"Very rude. Is not empathetic at all, does she have human emotions? no one knows."
He is awful. His instructions are confusing. He gives very long exam reviews and then not of it is on the actual exam. You get a minute to answer each question on Exams and they are the majority of your grade.
"Not a very good professor, but not the worst. Like going to Mcdonalds when you want Chick-Fila."
"inspirational, caring"
"He\'s a good professor. His lectures aren\'t to long or boring, he does group and solo activities so you aren\'t just sitting there listening to him talk. There wasn\'t a lot of reading from the textbook and he is a nice person. I would recommend his class because it\'s not boring, he isn\'t rude, and the material is interesting."
"Organized lectures, great prof, cares about students, best in A&M Commerce, don\'t complain, takes time with students"
best prof in this univ
"Amazing teacher. Ms Phillips has GREAT lectures. Don\'t miss them. She gives practice tests. Do them! The semester project was time consuming, but you learn a lot. Labs are fun, laid back, and fairly easy. Lab reports - follow rubric and you do fine. One of the BEST teachers at TCC. Five stars!"
"I LOVED Prof P. Her assignments were not difficult - film summary, labs were fun. Tests are open book for the most part. If you run into any ""life issues"" as she calls them, email her. She REALLY cares about you. Definitely best instructor I\'ve had online. Responds to emails. Did you know you can\'t feed your cat milk? Would take again, if I could."
"Prof Phillips is a great teacher. Definitely one of my favorites at TCC. She really cares. I learned a lot. But, I had to work hard! Tests are fair, usually there is a practice test. Start your semester project early! I loved this class and wish she taught other classes."
Great teacher. If you are a hard worker you will pass.
"Mrs. Phillips is a very caring teacher. She will work with your schedule. Just ask. She loves biology and expects a lot. But, I appreciate that as a major. Keep up... take good notes. She is very fair. I loved the class and Mrs. Phillips."
"Mary Wells Phillips, BIO for Majors. She is a great professor. She can be a bit confusing but SHE CARES. Shes super sweet, and cares for her students education. You WILL have to do a semester project that deals with research or volunteering work and a presentation for all of it. You can either choose a research project or to volunteer."
"I enjoyed the class A LOT. The first couple of labs were a little confusing but after that the remaining labs were great. Professor Phillips was always well organized and always wanted her students to succeed. Even though I have not been big into science or biology, this class taught me a lot. Very nice and helpful when ""life happens."""
"Prof. Phillips was an amazing teacher! If you put fourth an effort, you will pass. Very responsive on emails. Very good lectures. A wonderful Professor and person."
Great instructor and person. Very organized. Gives great feedback. Practice exams! YEAH!!!! Makes you ask questions. Wish she taught other courses. Absolutely recommend Ms. Phillips. LOVED her and her class!!
"Prof. Phillips was one of my favorite professors I\'ve had so far! I took her blended Biology class, so I only saw her for a Lab once a week. The weekly workload was very clearly lined out and I knew what was due and when. She was pretty lenient on due dates if you asked her, and was always willing to help. I would highly recommend!"
Prof. Phillips was awesome! She is an extremely kind woman who will help you out if you ask. She\'s also very flexible with due dates. I learned a lot but there were times when I was just confused on what to expect/do. Tests and assignments weren\'t too bad. There is one big semester project that took up a lot of time. Take Prof. Phillips. Loved her!
"Theres not really much to say about her besides she is an amazing teacher. She loves what she does and when she starts to get in to it you can see her eyes light up. She is incredibly sweet, and will help you if you fall behind. Tests and quizzes are open book, and the semester project is BIG! but worth it in the end."
Professor Phillips is a very good professor. She really cares about her students and wants to seeyou succeed. Her lectures can be confusing sometimes because she goes off on tangents. She responds to emails in a timely manner and is always willing to help out after class if you have questions. Just remember to go to class or you will get lost.
"Mrs. Phillips was not the best at getting back to you on time via email, but if you stayed after class to talk, she is more than willing to hear you out and fix any problems your having."
"I really loved Professor Phillips. I genuinely enjoyed attending her class each week. There were sometimes when the assignments were a bit confusing, but she was extremely lenient with due dates when she knew that we were confused. She always e-mailed back very fast and was always very willing to meet up whenever needed. She is also super nice!"
"Professor Phillips is TERRIFIC! She loves biology and cares about her students. She is knowledgeable and will try to explain things so that you can understand. Everything is posted on Bb, so if you miss a lecture, you won\'t get too lost. I enjoyed the labs and videos. I highly recommend!"
"Due to illness/family issues I was only able to show up to class once a week (for our exams every Friday) and yet I managed to pass with a 80%. Class was not difficult, but it was a hassle to receive our grades and marks. And even now that the semester is over, I still do not have a final mark/grade."
"Shane\'s a hilarious teacher, he always wanted to take the time to help out students do the best they could. If you try in this class its an easy A."
"Shane is a great teacher! He always makes sure everyone understands and is totally willing to help with problems, even if it means looking into it after hours for a student. His lessons are clear and leave you prepared to complete the labs and in class assessments."
"Great instructor. Sadly not enough variety on exercises. Lab and Quiz questions half the time are not near what you were taught. Lectures are great and he is available to answer any questions. But, his grading system is way too strict and he will deduct marks for the most minor error that has no effect on the code itself. Expect 15-20% less mark."
"Honestly i thought Dwayne Rurka was the best professor i have even encountered at N.A.I.T.. The lectures were interesting, he made sure the students were included in the arguments and he kept us on out toes. i really took in what he taught from his classes and have new respect for other perspectives. So i want to say thank you."
"Sure he might be a bit rough, but he explains the ins and outs of design. From Sequence Diagrams, Use Cases to Screen Designs. He\'s able to point the flaws and mistakes when you submit a document."
"His exams are fair- half multiple choice and half long answer, and he gives partial credit even if you mess up. I didn\'t do a whole lot of work and I still almost got a B-, so try and it\'s an easy course."
"Ok prof- he likes to talk about concepts instead of solving lots of problems in class, which helps with understanding but all the tests are only on the questions. You have to attend DGDs for that. But all past tests can be found online with answers and he seems to reuse the same questions every year so its not too hard to do well on his exams."
"Overall a good professor. With all the bonus marks and ""gift"" marks, he makes it pretty hard to fail his class. He does extra review sessions before midterms and the final exam and it\'s really useful to attend them. He\'s a great lecturer but be prepared to do a great amount of work in his class or you won\'t get a good grade."
Probably the funniest prof I had last semester. He is a fair guy and gives you lots of opportunities to do well in the course. He tosses free bonus marks. Go to dgd\'s there are quizzes that can result in bonus marks. For 1321 (or 1331) he provides you with all of his course notes which has everything you need for the course. FInd old exams!!!!!!!!!
"Very fair at marking and is really really funny! His classes were the highlight of my semester, can\'t wait for PHY 1322!"
"He gets angry at students from time to time, and I can\'t remember ever being on schedule in his class. He skips over some content in class (sometimes would ask TAs to make up for it in DGDs). The assignments are hard, but if you can do them you\'re good for the midterms. Exam was more challenging in addition to being entirely multiple choice."
"Sends the most hilarious emails, if you don\'t get his sarcasm you will hate him, accent is thick but still easy to understand. Attending the lectures is a must, content isn\'t posted online. Doing an assignment every week is annoying but easily brings up your grade. Midterms and exams were fair to what we saw in class, posts old tests and breakdown."
"Not the best teacher. He goes over a lot of the assignments in class and makes it VERY difficult to fail. I failed a midterm and the final and still managed to pass with over a 60. Also, DO THE EXTRA CREDIT, It can take pretty close to 10% off the final exam. Very difficult class if you didn\'t take high school physics. GO TO CLASS, it\'s worth it"
"Reviewers say Czajkowski is rude, but that\'s because no one understand sarcasm these days. I found him to be very nice/genuine outside of lectures (office hours), where you can talk to him 1 on 1. Many complain about how heavy the course is, but assignments are optional (bonus points). 1331 kids are also salty since they didn\'t take HS physics."
"There are assignments every week, which although is a lot, only 240 of 310 possible points actually counts which leaves out 2-3 assignments. You only lose BONUS marks from him if you ask questions from a lecture 2 weeks ago. There are many practice quizzes at the DGDs to help you. He\'s a great prof and wants to help, but it\'s a difficult course."
"He is rude. When you talk to him, he turns your back towards you and starts talking to somebody else. On the final exam, he changed the order of the questions but forgot to change the order of the answers. In addition, the scanner missed some answers. We were shocked when we received the results but he would not believe us that something went wrong"
"He is a VERY tough grader. He docks points for almost anything. All his tests are completely fill in and are very confusing. He is biased towards his book, being that he is the co-author & doesn\'t try to explain concepts in a different way even when students don\'t understand. He does not show interest or concern about his students. DO NOT TAKE HIM"
"Challenging class but smart and funny teacher. You must READ the book and take careful notes on how to do the exercises on the quizzes and tests. If you memorize the definitions and follow the examples, it\'s not that hard."
"Do ALL the work. To get an A it is ESSENTIAL you understand the material. It is not simply knowledge based, but application. This class is basically using COMMON SENSE/LOGIC to see if an argument is bad or good. It will be HARD if you don\'t understand the material. if you actually pay attention and understand it, it is EASY. Extra Credit Possible."
"Dr. Snider is amazing. It\'s true his tests are very difficult and his lectures are in depth, but he makes you want to do well in his class. Very easy to get help outside of class and makes it worth your while to go talk to him. He is also great for lab!"
"He is hilarious, but a tough grader. if you go to office hours he would be gladly to help. Overall just a great person to talk to."
"Snider is not an easy grader. If you want an A in his class, you will work for it. On the other hand he is hilarious and never fails to keep your attention. SIAB for life!"
"First off, Dr. Snider is hilarious! He adds humor to the chemistry which makes it a lot more bareable. The only complaint is that he grades formal labs extremely hard - it\'s almost impossible to get an A. Luckily, the other assignments will boost your grade and he was always willing to answer questions inside & outside of class."
"I\'m amazed at the students who praise her, and can only conclude those were students she decided were good enough to favor, as she does this a lot. She covers way too much material at an insane pace. I type faster than average and could not keep up. You better be taking ONLY this course or have an amazing memory."
"I love this guy, he really wants his students to succeed and he\'s a funny guy. There\'s a quiz almost every week and only 2 exams. If you read the book and do homework problems on the stuff you don\'t understand you should be set for an A. He lets you have a cheat sheet too for the exams."
"One of the best math professors I\'ve ever had. Attendance isn\'t optional, however if you attend most of his classes, he\'ll give you extra credit at the end of the semester. Final was lightweight and took half of the period. Real chill prof, will be taking him again in the future."
"The best math professor in his field. Makes difficult concepts very easy to understand. Gives homework everyday for practice but also solves it for you next day, do those and you are all set. Extremely intelligent, helpful and knowledgeable. Makes learning easy by the way he teaches. Take him if you want to learn, be good at math & get a good grade"
Great!
This teacher is amazing. Best math teacher in the whole department. You will never regret taking his math class. I am terrible at math but he is helpful and makes his goal to make his students pass. He is like a friend.
"I\'ve always hated math and have only been average at it, but Professor Wang makes it so easy and straightforward! His class was a really easy A, and like I said, I\'m not great at math. He\'s also super cute like he makes jokes, is passionate about math, and is overall very likable :) Would definitely take him again."
His accent is easy to get used to. He does have a sense of humor. Homework is not graded and he only suggests 15-20 problems each week. Quizzes are once a week as well but they are max 3-5 questions and exactly from the homework. Exams are based on the quizzes. If you hate math-take him! Lectures are simple and to the point-he is a great teacher!
"Professor Chung is a great teacher! Sometimes, he copies and pastes HW questions directly from the textbook onto the exams, and he usually tells the class beforehand what kind of questions there\'ll be. Be prepared for free response questions along with multiple choice & T/F. Overall, if you study hard, you\'ll get an A."
"No sympathy for anyone who struggles in this class. Prof. Chung gives review guides and his exams are quite similar to his exams. Even if you\'re not a finance major, this class isn\'t difficult and he is a good prof. The material isn\'t challenging and really it is an important course. Make sure you attend class because the powerpoints are blank"
"I really like Finance and this class was a bit of a challenge. Gives hints on what\'s on the test and lectures are clear. I read the book for a better understanding. Goes through a lot of information during lecture, so make sure to go because powerpoints have many many blanks."
"Took two finance classes: BUS 106 and BUS 134 with Professor Chung. His midterms are fairly easy compared to final exam like most of the classes. He gives you study reviews before every exam and you are pretty much guaranteed B+ given that you studied all those. As long as you know his lectures, HW set A and study review, getting A is not difficult"
I loved Professor Sadkowski. He\'s a very funny guy with somewhat interesting lectures. You have to read a lot in his class or else you won\'t pass. His quizzes are based from his mini-books you have to read along with the class one. Read or else you won\'t pass. It\'s pretty hard to without them.
"WAY too much work for an LAC Humanities course. He\'s a great, funny guy, but this class was difficult and I went to every class and hardcore studied. The course guidebook helps IMMENSELY- it has study guides in it, but tests are still difficult. Make sure you read the books he assigns. The grading scale is SUPER lenient- I got a 75% which is a B."
"Sadkowski was a nice guy but his lectures were really boring and there was a lot of reading involved. Tests were difficult but he has a pretty nice grading scale, so it evens out a bit."
"Sadkowski is the worst professor I\'ve had at UNI. Sadkowski lacks organization, shows up late to class daily, is regularly not prepared, and fails to make this course interesting. He relies on the textbook to cover all of his material. Sadkowski teaches heavily through pointing at maps and listing European countries, dates, and leaders rapidly."
"Overall I was pleased with the class mainly lectures, some movies every now and then, and you don\'t need to do the readings. Sometimes it was hard to stay awake, but it got better as time went on. Tests were easy if you paid attention, and is very humorous. One of the negatives is that you now have to pay for the course packet, but overall great."
"Peters was good but the class was a lot of work. For an LAC class, I spent more time doing tests and homework than for my major classes. There are 6 tests and they are all online (30-40 MC with a strict time limit), but the final is in class (100 multiple choice). There are also 4 article reflections throughout the semester that took a lot of time."
"Only grades are papers and exams, he is a tough grader! You have an extra credit opportunity where you can type three papers, but you can only get a total of ONE combined. All tests are on quizlet but you only get 40 minutes for 40 questions. I thought the class was super boring. You have a total of 6 papers. Attendance is required."
"FYI Professor Scott Peters is listed on MyUniverse as Christopher S Peters. Dr. Peters has been an amazing professor for every class I have taken with him. He is so knowledgable on our county\'s courts system, and he is so good at teaching in a way that is understandable to those with no knowledge of law or politics. Highly recommend this professor!"
Whole outline of class is done by working in groups. Very very little class time spent on lecturing and more focused on working at your respective groups. He\'s extremely intelligent and further sparked a passion in politics for me. Don\'t take if you\'re wanting an easy class. He makes you work for it.
"DONT TAKE HER. She is extremely unprofessional, talks about personal life in class A LOT yet still expects you to somehow learn materials and take tests on them. Basically a huge waste of time and money. Tests are confusing and unclear, will tell you you\'re wrong when you question her. Have to teach yourself basically."
"Dr. P is an odd character but overall Psych of Women is very easy. The class consists of 3 or 4 take home exams, and no homework or quizzes (very easy). She will go off on a tangent for hours if you let her."
"I didn\'t buy the book because she wasn\'t here for the first week of classes. Ended up with a B- and I don\'t normally get B\'s. She does not teach, she reads. 4 tests, all multiple choice. Last 2 tests she gave study guides because no one was passing. She\'s pretty out-there and rambles a lot. May have done better if I bought the book but unnecessary."
"This class was really easy. Everything that was on the exam was somewhere in his lecture notes that he has for you on canvas. If you read those, and do the assignments, then you should be fine."
"I\'ve spoken with a few other students and we have all had similar problems this past quarter. The practices for exams are nothing like the actual exams, and the questions on homework can be extremely confusing. Doesn\'t really post much in the class or answer messages in a timely manner. No notes allowed, even though you must memorize a lot."
"This professor was awesome! He gives a lot of opportunity for extra credit, way more than any other professor I have had. It\'s really hard to fail this class. He drops the lowest of 4 exams which means if you like your grade, NO FINAL! Homework and discussions you get full points for just for turning it in on time. There are no surprises!"
"Give grade with no rules. You will not understand were your lost the point. And he will gives low grade to who has controverisal to him. It\'s unfair. And you will not get time to make up your assignment if you missed homework, even you have any reaosn. Too much detailed things that you mighy missed. Be careful to choose."
I enjoyed Sorem\'s teaching style and clear cut expectations. He actually reads your posts and provides you with specific feedback. I would take him in a heartbeat! Who knew I would love Econ. Thanks Prof!
"Amazing professor. Class was easy to follow. Took it online and he included lectures every week to go along with the reading. Usually his lectures helped so much I didn\'t have to read the book. Easy to get in contact with, super helpful, and responds quickly."
"great teacher, took this class to see I would like to go into business. hes a great guy long lectures and easy homework once a week i missed a few but he gives out alot of extra credit options"
Awesome professor who made Economics lectures interesting. I was well-prepared for exams and all information tested on was covered during class lectures in detail.
"I thoroughly enjoyed my Econ 110 class with Sorem. He\'s very knowledgeable about his subject, and goes into great detail about what he wants you to learn and take out of his lectures. He\'ll emphasize what he wants you to get out of his learning, and the parts you need to focus on."
PROF MOORE WAS THE BEST MATH TEACHER IVE EVER HAD. IM NOT GOOD AT MATH AT ALL AND SHE ACTUALLY HELPED ME UNDERSTAND ALL OF THE MATERIAL. I RECOMMEND HER. SHES SO PASSIONATE ABOUT HER JOB.
"Great teacher but I felt this class was designed more for full-time students. 3 hour lectures twice a week, fairly grueling online homework, and online quizzes and tests almost every Friday and Saturday! I would not recommend if you work, especially full-time. Loved the online platform MOM, but could not handle the overall time commitment."
"This professor was amazing at explaining how to derive the equations she was teaching us. She not only explained why we needed to learn the material but applied it to real life. If you\'ve ever had officer hours with her, you\'ll find she truly wants you to learn the material and will help you in any way she can."
"Mrs. Malitsky does not explain anything in class, just teaches out of the textbook word for word. The exams are ridiculously hard and the examples in the class lecture and homework do not help you prepare for them. Unless you\'re a math genius and know what you\'re doing I wouldn\'t recommend taking this class."
"Professor Malitsky was helpful with homework classes during lectures, but her lectures were verbatim from the textbook. So when I attended lectures, I did not need to read from the textbook. I did the minimum work for the class and scored the highest score on the final. The material isn\'t hard, but the teacher is a little boring. But, she is nice."
"Professor Malitsky\'s lectures are read straight out of the textbook but she doesn\'t cover everything in the required textbook so, if you go to class, you don\'t need to read the textbook. I would suggest going to class because she does help with the online homework assignments. Not a bad professor, but her Polish accent takes a while to get used to."
Professor Malitsky is not a very effective teacher. There is no discussion section for this class and all her lectures are problems straight out of the book. She is also not friendly at all. All of the exams that go along with this class are a lot harder than any examples she does in lecture and are very hard to be well prepared for.
"Incredible teacher, has a great sense of humor, and a true sense to ensure her students are learning material. Curves and other grades are very fair, but you have to work for your grade."
"Long boring lectures and exams that don\'t accurately represent what was taught in the homework, as well as in lecture. However, the exams are heavily curved."
"Prof. goes though lectures extremely quick and easily left behind if. Test were extremely hard, and hard to understand."
Love Dr. Kim Park she is very straight to the point. There are ABSOLUTELY NO SURPRISES in her class. Very nice grader too! Surprisingly a funny professor too you just have to catch her in the right moment! Doesn\'t use text. Homework is online. Very prompt grader I was worried about this class but she made it very basic and easy to understand!
"Dr. Kim Park teaches EXTREMELY fast. She is willing to go over problems multiple times (with a little sass) till you get it. She is available during office hours and is helpful there too. Exams are straight forward and mostly from the notes/homework, no surprises. She\'s also really relatable. 3 exams, 1 final, homework. 500 pts. Provides formulas."
"She\'s a great professor. Pay attention if you haven\'t taken stats, but if you did then it\'s pretty much review. I suggest going to tutoring, and do the homework. It really helps with practice. Go to lectures, they\'re important. Tests are easy if you know what you\'re doing. I suggest her as a stats professor. No midterm, cheatsheet for final! Easy."
"Lets you know exactly what will be on the upcoming tests (as long as you stay until the end of class)! Extra credit is easy -- things like go on a hike, or draw and label a cell. She\'s a great instructor."
"Honestly it all depends on the student. I\'m not good at biology at all, but reading the book actually helped a lot because I wouldn\'t grasp anything while I was in lecture. There are 4-5 midterms which are way better, than just the one because it\'ll be 2-3 chapters at a time rather than chapters 1-10 for only 1 big accumulative midterm. Take her!"
Professor Dilek is a great professor. She is very caring and always ready to help. She provides study guides and review sessions when possible. He has 4 mid term tests. She does offer extra credit that involves going on a field trip. I would definitely recommend her she is great. You won\'t regret taking her.
"She is such a great teacher! She literally helps you out with anything you don\'t get and makes it easier to understand. She gives you all the reviews before exams and finals, they can be hard though if you don\'t study. Very nice and helpful teacher. Would definitely recommend her!"
"I loved this class and this professor. It was a hybrid class, which meant we only came in once a week for labs, and learned the lecture material ourselves. I was pretty worried about the labs and dissections but they were actually pretty easy. The lecture material isn\'t too hard to grasp if you read the book. Great class she offers extra credit!"
"I thought bio was going to be very boring, but she managed to make it so much fun to the point that i was looking forward to her class & lab. She gives easy hw, she will tell you everything that\'s on the tests, & will have little reviews. She\'s willing to stay after class to help out. She\'s super sweet & her lectures are awesome! would take again!"
"Professor was awesome. I took the hybrid class (Lecture online, Monday lab only). The test can be difficult but if you do the homework and the study guides online, you will pass. Make sure to show up and do the extra credit. One of the best teachers I\'ve ever had and one of the easiest going and understanding professors I know. Thanks professor!"
"I have never been able to understand this subject until I took her class. She offers Extra Credit questions on Exams, making it much easier to get a higher score. Very clear and straight forward and is always willing to help if you go to her for it. Overall you could not ask for a better Professor! Highly recommended!"
She\'s an amazing professor. As long as you study her notes you\'ll do fine on the tests
Amazing professor! I failed 2 tests (my fault for not studying) and I still passed the class with an A! She gives extra credit and makes biology easy to understand. Definitely would recommend anyone to take her
"Prof. Dilek was awesome! She teaches botany in a way that is easy to learn, supplementing her lectures with videos and relevant HW assignments. She offers extra credit and puts some into each test too. Just study her study guides and you will be fine. Labs were fun and creative. Would take her for any class she offers!"
"Our class was a 3hour lecture(T)/Lab(TH). At first those lectures were rough but Dilek is really passionate, she makes jokes, shows us videos, & keeps class interesting. Dilek accommodates to her students! I was really struggling but she took the extra time to additionally help me & adjust to my learning style. Dilek is an amazing professor!"
"BEST professor I\'ve ever had Makes the class extremely easy to pass,allowed to do extra credit throughout the semester You have to go to class because it is a lab class, obvious. Her lectures are super easy to comprehend and remember, she does review before every exam so its impossible to fail. She posts the textbook outlines on BB"
She is an amazing professor who goes above and beyond to make sure you understand the material . Take her over any other professor! I ended up with a B but only because i didn\'t study nor did i take the small quizzes important. The quizzes really add up!
I loved her class. I was very engaged throughout the entire semester. The class format is very straight forward and she gives some extra credit. The gives review sessions before each test which are very helpful. I highly recommend her for any class.
"If you can understand conceptual math by reading, then I suggest this course. Otherwise, you should take a lecture course. As long as you read and do the assignments, you can pass. They provide hints and explain how to solve several of the problems. However, if you\'re an accounting major, this probably won\'t help you memorize well."
"Easy A. Took a 5 week summer course. There\'s about 300 problems due every week through the learnsmart program in a system called connect, plus 8 homework questions. At first I didn\'t understand why everyone said this class is easy. Then I realized if you use all your resources, you\'ll find that the answers are right in front of your face."
"Professor Reed is a great professor, but if you are a conservative, he may offend you in many ways. He speaks greatly about ""Bernieites"" but as soon as he brings up President Trump, it\'s nothing but garbage. Besides his harsh opinion in lecture, the material he gives you helps you with the exams. SI sessions are a must if you want a good grade."
If you enjoy history Professor Reed is probably the best you can get. I found his lectures on point and enjoyable and he clearly has a vast knowledge of American history. He provides many real world and personal examples that are useful and make the class more enjoyable. He finds modern day things to compare history to to help you understand.
"Class was an easy A for me. I went 3 times (test days) and got an A. Tests are written essays and I always crammed 3 days before (It worked for me). Here\'s how you get an A... GO TO SI AND TA SESSIONS, email TA\'s about outline and thesis, study with flashcards, write 10-15 pages for essay (It sounds scary but it\'s easy to do), 10/10 would recommend"
"Not going to lie. How I passed this class is literally going to class a week before a midterm to get the questions and then, I googled the stuff before class on my drive to the university. When I did attend class, the lectures were long and never on topic. The TAs were no help either as they were too busy with their own studies to help."
"He\'s a smart and funny guy. He goes off topic here and there, but he covers all the information he needs. You will actually learn in his class. If you like history you\'ll like him. The class is pretty much just lecture with 3 midterms. It\'s not the easiest class that you\'ll ever take, but it\'s also a class made for freshmen."
"the only thing for your grade is 3 in class essays. and the lectures sometimes dont nessisarily relate to the midterms. however you can get all of the information by either reading the book, or going to the TA/SI led sessions"
"You have 3 exams, two worth 400 points and one worth 200 points, and this is the only thing on your grade. The exams are easy to pass as long as you go to the study sessions by the TA\'s! I\'ve only been to this class on exam days, most of the information you need is given to you during the study sessions. Just study and you\'ll do fine."
"Professor Reed, and his lectures, are very monotone, dry and boring. I only went to class twice outside of the tests (which are essays) and still received an A. Going to class and buying the book are not necessary at all. But going to the TA sessions the days before the tests are CRUCIAL to passing. They go over exactly what you should write."
"Professor Reed has clear, well constructed lectures that specifically prepare you for the exams. This is NOT a memorize and pass class. You need to be able to digest the information and explain diverse factors to support a thesis statement for the exams. The assigned reading is essential. TAKE notes, his lectures are very helpful."
He is a very sweet professor and does a great job to make sure we pass while understanding all of the concepts. I loved his class.
His class is fail proof! As long as you turn in all the excel assignments before the final you will be able to get full credit for them. That means you probably don\'t have to show up for the class. His assignments are very detailed which are meant to help you out. He tells a lot of jokes and is very sweet. Only a 10-week course!
"Mike is the best, amazing teacher great guy so funny, overall the best man out there."
He is super caring and actually wants everyone to pass. Let\'s you work through the excel assignments as you need to at your own pace. the class is kind of set in a way that the assignments are online and you kinda just sit in class and work on them. He has like little sheets you turn in as proof of doing the work.
It was a good Excel class. I entered without knowing how to use Excel and this class helped a lot. You can complete your assignment at home and print a screenshot of a part of your work to turn in the next class. Attendance is taken every class. I learned a lot overall and I enjoyed this class!
"Extremely chill. 2 weekly assignments, one in class, one for homework. He tells cheesy jokes every class and is super cool. It is a credit/no credit class and he grades mostly off of participation (completion of assignments). Very easy class with only a little bit of experience with excel."
"Go to class! Mike is very understanding so if you have conflicting responsibilities, talk to him. Takes late work. You can do assignments ahead of time and only show up to class for 15 minutes to get it checked. Encourages talking in class. Assignment grades based on whether you do them or not, not correctness. Allows internet usage/notes on exam."
"Prof Splane is the cutest professor ever. He really cares about you learning. He created all his assignments himself, and really wants students to get a good understanding so they have the most potential when they get out of college. Loved his class :-)"
"He\'s a great guy and a great prof! Just go to class and you\'ll ass. 1 in class, 1 homework assignment every week. Time consuming but easy. Helps you learn a lot about excel in a way that will actually help you in the real world. I can\'t stress enough to take him."
"Fun class, easy teacher and he\'s always smiling. Just show up do the assignment for the day and get an A! Joke of the day is the best"
"This class is an easy A IF you do well on the lecture exams which can be sort of difficult if you dont study. I showed up to lecture & sat on my phone the whole time but you have to show up for iclicker points. However, you only need to end up with 70% clicker to get 100% so you can miss a good amount. Labs are easy and exams are easy if you study"
"Glenn is really into computers and tries to instill this love of computers into everyone in the class. Lectures can be a little bor If sometimes but there is a lot of useful information that you can use in everyday life with your computer. If you show up, do Simnet training, and go to lab and put in a little effort it\'s an easy B/B+."
Lectures are long and boring. Class is easy if you are good with technology (word and excel). Definitely makes you work for your grade!
"I appreciate how clear Glen has made his grading criteria and class schedule. I just felt as tho his lecture exams had low balled questions on tiny details mentioned in lecture. Word exams are easy A\'s tho. Didn\'t enjoy this class, but you might."
"Glenn is a helpful professor who doesn\'t want you to fail. Makeup policies are good. You don\'t need the textbook but need the SIMnet pass which is pricey. Class is easy as long as you show up with the iClicker. Read his lectures before a test and you\'re good. Also, do the SIMnet tutorials, very helpful!"
"This class is as easy as you want to make it. Do the simnet trainings and you will do fine on those tests. get the easy iclicker points. Hardest part is the lecture exams, but they are fine if you show up to class moderately. Funny guy. Satisfies a major business requirement as well."
"Dr. Burns is the best professor I\'ve had at Texas Tech. He is very tough on you but once you graduate and you are in the real world, you will realize his class is of vital importance. His plethora of experiences (worked on Saturn V !!), professionalism, and knowledge of IT project management are all used in today\'s IT world."
"Dr. Burns has been in the Rawls since the building was erected. His class can be dry at times, but you learn what you need to for your future careers. He had a TA that graded our project grammar and we got a lot of points taken off (He averages the substance and grammar grades together). All in all, very difficult. Work hard and you will do fine."
25 homework questions from each lecture. 150 homework questions every 4 weeks. Tests are 70 questions most of which are the exact homework questions. Some questions are easy & some extremely specific. All of this while doing a semester long group project. FML. Class definitely has its pros and cons. Expect that it will take a lot of time.
I would avoid this professor if possible....
"All test are straight from HW, but you can\'t view the results until the day before the test. The last homework of every set gives you less than 12 hours to complete. Basically forces all-nighters. Can\'t find HW answers online, in text book, or from lecture content. Expects you to remember everything from stats and know excel."
"He knows the material; he\'s been teaching it forever. If you\'re interested in lower-level things and some hardware, you\'ll love the class. Otherwise, it\'s still a pretty simple class. Start assignments early. Read the book before lecture. Try to find exams from previous years as he gives no hints about what will be on them. The final was difficult."
Professor White delivers the best lectures in the Computer Science department at RIT. He makes it very clear that he will not waste his students\' time and teaches until the figurative bell rings. His lectures are always clear and follow a logical progression as the semester goes on.
"He doesn\'t know how to teach, and on midterms, he asked questions that he did not cover/lecture. AWFUL professor"
Phil White is honestly the best CS professor I\'ve had at RIT. His style of teaching is excellent and really helps you get a thorough understanding of the material. He is a very fair grader and is clear with his expectations. He is often blatantly sarcastic and has a good sense of humor. Overall a fantastic professor!
"This is the best class I have taken at U of O so far. It gives incredible insight into the dark side of self in religion just like the title suggests. Beyond that, it really teaches you a lot about yourself, I started my journey of self-discovery, which is something I did not think I would be saying. It is an amazing class, I highly recommend it."
Professor Unno gives amazing lectures but at times they can be confusing or he gets off track. He has a clear grading criteria but is picky in how he wants things done. Overall he is a kind professor who genuinely cares about his students and what he is talking about. He is very knowledgeable and I would recommend him.
"Mark Unno is an amazing profesor. He\'s hilarious and the amount of work you have to do is really reasonable. There\'s 2 short tests and a few papers. The readings are pretty basic, too. I\'m by no means a 4.0 person but this class is very doable."
"Too hard of a grader for a 101 class. GE grades, but follows Unno\'s guidelines and it\'s a bit ridiculous. I\'m no straight A student, but I do well on essays and I got a grade I wasn\'t expecting. My GE later said it\'s hard to receive an A on essays in this class. Essays are a good part of the class. First test also included Q\'s about grammar? Why?"
"He\'s really funny if your class is well behaved. He really likes teaching. It\'s not a super fun class, but he makes it fun."
"If you don\'t go to class, don\'t expect to do well, even though attendance isn\'t mandatory. It can feel like a waste of time, but if you bother listening, you\'ll understand the material better especially come time for the final. If you do well on tuneups and the appendix hw then you\'ll do fine on exams and the final, they\'re exactly the same thing."
"She is so off the wall and hard to follow. Entire grade is based off of 3 exams, masteringphysics and one final. That\'s IT. Her exams are all multiple choice and super specific to how she teaches. If you dont write down exactly how to do her problems, good luck."
"Professor Barden is amazing, lots of extra credit provided and gives awesome memorable examples, which helps to understand the material and that\'s how I studied! Awesome professor!"
One of the easiest classes at mcp as of yet for me.. 100% would take him again if I could! I cannot recommend him enough. Study the slides and you\'ll do great on the exams (all MC). Extremely easy A. Lab is also much easier than freshman bio labs!
Ned is an easy professor. Just review the slides before the exam and you will get an A. He gives numerous amounts of extra credit. If you pay attention in lecture then reviewing won\'t be much at all. There are old exams and study guides to prepare you. Easy A
He was a great professor very specific in what is and is not going to be on the exam.
"Awesome professor, he made Micro interesting. Such a genuine and funny guy, he really cares about his students and does a great job portraying the material. All of his lectures are online which helps with exams so much. Would 100% take him again if my major required me to. Great dad jokes."
"Boring lectures, makes you work too hard for the grade, taught an under-grad level course for grad students, exams are too lengthy designed not check your knowledge"
"There weren\'t many actual lecture,since 80% of the class were presentations held by students. The grading criteria was very unclear, although he usually gave good grades. But be aware, all assignments were group projects with the same group throughout the semester."
He is really nice at teaching. He won\'t mind at all even if you go and ask him the same thing thrice. TA\'s can be better. He grades well if you write your answers correctly. I amd my friends always scored more than what we expected.
"Dr. Tandy is a sweet lady. This will not safe you however when it comes to passing this class if you don\'t work for it. Tests are very tough and there is really no time to study since the semester is full of incredibly long HWs, assignments, SUA, outside of class events and activities. Study early and get ready for tests a long time in advance."
"Excessive work and a waste of time. Learned more from professors at CSN than from this woman. SUA, connect homework, networking events, and not enough time for exams. She comes to class smiling, but it\'s a smile welcoming you to hell. Also, get ready to spend money on class materials. NOT WORTH IT."
"Took it online over summer. That was the first mistake, unfortunately I had no other option. Took her 1-2 days to respond to my emails & even then, they were unhelpful. McGraw-Hill based course which sucks. Not enough time for the exams and will leave you rushing to guess. Unnecessary/tedious amounts of homework which take hours of your day. BEWARE"
You have to make sure that you attendant class throughout the entire 8 weeks. Lecture is something that you don\'t want to miss because almost every week you have a quiz due that\'s based off lecture. Taking notes is always the best so that you can go over your notes and be sure to pass your quiz. Didn\'t use the book as much so i wouldn\'t get it.
By far the hardest class I\'ve ever taken. This class was SO hard. I studied all the time. Cynthia\'s lecture is all over the place and it makes it very hard to take good notes. She\'s very scatterbrained and her lecture is confusing with the powerpoint she makes. She won\'t help you very much in the lab. Wish I could explain some more but I ran out.
"She is the sweetest professor, she is kind of difficult but if you listen and study you will be fine."
"Cynthia really makes sure you know she is there to help you at anytime. She even came to our study group on a Sunday in her personal time. She expects you to work at learning, not just show up. Anyone saying she\'s a bad professor wasn\'t willing to put the work in. Tests are a little tricky, be careful."
"Cynthia doesn\'t play, she expects you to pre-read the material before coming to class each day. Then in class she expects participation. She will ask you questions. She tries to guide u to the answer but is often confusing how she does it. She was very helpful outside of class. She seems intimidating but is truly a kind soul. Ask & she will help."
"I loved Cynthia and the way she taught her class. She lets you know she\'s there for you the whole way through. You definitely won\'t float through cell biology because it\'s not an easy subject but if you do the work as she suggests and participate in class you\'ll be fine. She\'s so passionate about what she teaches, a truly awesome professor."
"I gave Cynthia some credit for being encouraging but her tests are ridiculously hard and she is not approachable in lab for questions. Her midterms and final exams are beyond what anyone should be expected to know, and when you ask a question in lab she will only tell you that you\'re not correct and walk away instead of being more supportive."
"Cynthia will see you for what you are. Don\'t take her classes if they\'re a check in the box for your degree program. But if you\'re passionate, and actually care about the subject matter, Cynthia is an incredible leader help you realize your goals. She WILL let you know if you aren\'t cut out for the field. Which is a much needed trait in a teacher"
"Cynthia expects you to already know the material in class before learning it,and when you ask questions she makes you feel stupid and says you should already know the answer and tells you to ask class members for the answer. very scatterbrained jumps from topic to topic. i learned absolutely nothing from her, i learned more by teaching myself."
"Cynthia is a very great instructor, she really does her best to get everyone involved! I enjoyed her class very much, but I\'m not much of a morning person. So my brain was only half awake! Very sweet lady!"
This was by far the worst class of ALL my classes offered at KVCC. This Instructor talks way above your head. Doesn\'t offer any extra credit to help you out and if you let her know you are struggling she will tell you straight to your face that you should reconsider your goals for the future!!! Horrible
"Cynthia is completely scatterbrained. She adds new assignments randomly and due dates change all the time, so you get confused by all of her confusion. Takes forever to grade. Exams hardly reflect lecture at all. Talks above what most people even know yet, like we are already microbiologists, when we\'re actually there to LEARN.... Horrible teacher."
"Professor Schauer is a passionate, compassionate person. She is patient beyond measure and helps students succeed. She fosters a place of learning, not just spitting out the right answers. Schauer encourages questions, not just perfection. She takes classes out of her profession so she understands being clueless!Awesome person in and out of class!"
WORST PROFESSOR EVER! I have never had anything below an A in English and I have a D. I have never been so dissappointed in a professor in my life. She is terrible and she is very mean and often comes off as rude. She calls people out and she tears them apart. shes like a vicious DRAGON. she skipped class more than I did and were way behind.
Awful
"Hey, I got a B, shes not that bad"
"An honest (yet sometimes hard hitting) professor who excels at making you put effort into work at the things you need to accomplish for the class. Do not expect to go in for an ""Easy A"", and do not expect there to be special treatment. You do the work, you earn your grade. Whether it\'s good or bad, that\'s on you. Read. Don\'t mess around."
"This is the worst teacher at hvcc. DO Not take her class. she is not a good teacher at all. she does not help. she does not give any good advise. drinks coffee and chocolate bars all class. grades really tough my friend told me to drop her before school started and i should have listened. absolute worst ""professor""out there."
"She\'s nice, but a tough grader. You have to do all the work and keep up or you will fail."
"Professor Dearing\'s class is definitely not easy but she is without a doubt a great teacher. You really have to work for a good grade and attendance is mandatory to pass. Overall she was very helpful though, and wants success for her students. I would not recommend this class if you don\'t like reading. She also was very helpful with writing papers."
"Dr. Tompkins teaches for understanding, not memorization. Come to class, participate and pay attention. Hi lecture videos are exactly what he taught in class so if you don\'t understand something, watch it until you get it. His quizzes are short, but difficult. I cannot stress enough how important coming to class and paying attention are."
"Genuinely difficult professor to navigate, but that is mostly because he tries to make sure you understand the material, which his quizzes and exams directly reflect. Do not bother skipping class because he teaches directly from his powerpoints and will quiz you accordingly. Really tried and still made a 79.5. Yeah, and he doesn\'t round up either."
"Tompkins is a very good teacher who cares about you UNDERSTANDING not memorizing the material. His youtube videos are extremely helpful, but his tests and quizzes are extremely challenging and quite difficult. He does not care about your grade and makes it nearly impossible to get an ""A"" in his class. Too much information to learn for a 4 week clas"
"He is not that hard if you just want to pass. 6 quizzes are 85% of your grade, but they are only few questions each. He grades purely on the curve. His teaching style is to give you a solid understanding of the material which enables you to pass any test he throws at you. He has lectures on YouTube, which REALLY help. Very light workload."
Really great and caring teacher. Offers videos of all lectures so that you can study. He wants you to understand the material and is ALWAYS willing to meet for extra help. Prefers to call you on the phone to answer questions over emailing. Tough grader but completely fair.
Very hard class. Does not use textbook. Wants you to learn to derive formulas you will not ever use; tests impossible; DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!!!!!
Wonderful professor. Truly cared that you learn and his efforts show it.
"Professor Tony Hage is an AMAZING instructor I strongly recommended him, very passionate, explains in detail, making complex info., easy to understand, shwd short cut, go above and beyond to help students, plenty of reviews & materials, available before & after class, 3exams, labs, & a final. Overall, an excellent professor! I would take him agai"
"am really i took your class, what a blessing, he taught like an african teacher from Ghana. he will make u love chemistry. oh my God he doesnt run from questions. his in class lecture notes are the best. am done with the class but i have his lectures still in memory. i will take u again for pleasure just to be good with calculations. dont miss him"
I WILL SAY THAT HE IS THE BEST TEACHER I HAVE EVR HAD SINCE I CAME TO THE UNITED STATES. HE IS VERY ATTENTIVE AND THOROUGH WITH HIS TEACHING. TO ADD TO IT ALL HE IS VERY CONSIDERATE.I THINK HE IS A REAL GEM AND HE HAS MADE ME A CHEMISTRY LOVER! GOOD JOB PROFESSOR! KEEP IT UP!
Great professor! He is very passionate about chemistry and will explain it as many times as you need so you understand it! I would definitely take a course taught by him again! If you listen and try then you can easily get an A .
One of the best professors I have ever had.
Mary is overall a good teacher. You do not need the textbook just the lab manual. We almost never had lab or lecture quiz\'s even though we are supposed to. She gives out occasional extra credit. Ask questions if you have any because she is not the best at explaining things. For the practicals I would recommend using Quizlet to help you study.
Mary is straight forward. She only teaches the material necessary. Quizzes are from lab activities done in groups so attendance is important to get these points. As long as you do the work and study you will do well. She has a great sense of humor and I really liked her teaching style. I feel I learned what I needed to.
"This professor has a tendency to get off topic incredibly easy. She is a very nice and funny person, but scatter brained is saying it nicely. Be prepared to teach yourself a lot on your own time, lecture heavy with little hands on learning."
Dr. Brown is a great professor. She does tend to get off topic often but she\'s funny and cares a lot about her students passing! I can\'t wait to take another class with her.
"Very disorganized. Will waste your time, for sure, with odd musings and unrelated tangents. Makes it very clear how little she knows. Often behind on material. Uses the lab time to make up lecture time. Doesn\'t give the ""big picture,"" so you will have to teach yourself the material. On the upside, the exams are pretty easy if you use study guide"
Dr. Brown is a great professor. Anatomy is a very challenging course be she makes it enjoyable and understandable . This was my second time around taking Anatomy and with Dr. Brown as a professor I passed with a B! Make sure to keep up with notes provided. The greatest tool to passing this course is REVIEWING and using online lab tutorials.
"She is funny, energetic, and really gets the students engaged in the class. The notes seem hard to keep up with at first but it\'s basically an outline of the lecture shes giving and it goes in order, you just have to follow along. She cares about her students and wants them to succeed so if you go to her with quesitons she is always willing to help"
"The best instructor I ever had, she makes learning easy because she makes sure you know the most important things. she focuses what you need know for real life and exam which makes grading easy. I got A in her class of Anatomy and you can also get that as long as you strive for it."
The most amazing teacher you\'ll ever have!! Super funny and is always there to help. takes the time to meet with you and explain stuff. She is pretty straight forward on what she wants you to know.
His lectures were very clear and often simplified the material for us. His midterm exam was much easier compared to other sections. All in all he was a good teacher in class and kept the class entertaining with his slides. However on the downside he would sometimes seem annoyed or bothered to answer questions outside of class or at office hours.
FINA 405 with him is considered a CAPSTONE FINA course. You\'ll be solving cases and presenting throughout the semester. It\'s extremely useful for finance students looking to apply what they have learned. It\'s a very demanding course but you\'ll be ready for the workforce thereafter. He used to manage a multi billion hedge fund. The best prof w/ expe
"Don\'t take class if you don\'t like group projects or presenting in front of class. The group project very difficult but you will learn a lot as well. His lectures are hilarious, but the group presentations are often tedious. Very respected teacher and will listen to you. His exams are very fair as well."
"Worst teacher i had in JMSB, he doesn\'t teach you anything and doesn\'t care about his students, you don\'t know how he grades you, sent him 3 emails to review my exams he never replied, horrible teacher"
"Taking this class was a negative experience. the grading seemed very random, with little feedback and no clear criteria. Instructions for the midterm were unclear. Help for the project was very vague, with most of the valuation skills learned online... no one failed the course, but there were very few As and no one knows why they got their grade"
"""One of the worst at JMSB Finance. Avoid at all costs. Random grading criteria (basically gives you a good grade if he knows you). If you insist on taking a class with him, focus more on becoming his friend rather than spending too much time trying to get assignments/projects/exams right."" From another review, but my thoughts exactly. Wow."
He is SO funny and so kind. His class is so much fun even if science doesn\'t interest you. His lectures are never boring and as long as you come to class and pay attention the exams are really easy. Great guy!
One of the most knowledgeable and helpful professors I have had at Grand Valley! I would recommend taking any class that he teaches!
Great professor. Bio isn\'t really my thing but his sense of humor and stories he would tell (related to class topics) made class more interesting. Really cares about students and definitely wants to make sure we all succeed. Couldn\'t have picked a better professor.
"I wish Prof. Dobson taught 226 because he would be my first choice. He is an amazing professor who knows what he is talking about. All of class is lecture but it is engaging and easy to follow along. Sometimes he talks super fast, but if you ask him to repeat something, he will do it right away and make sure you understand. I highly recommend him!"
This teacher is great just a tough class
"One of the greatest professors I\'ve had the pleasure of getting to learn from. Very tough material but thats biology for yah, he did an incredible job at explaining methods."
Wants all students to do well but makes it damn near impossible. Does not give any extra credit and does not curve any exams which is annoying when all other professors curve their grades. Hard tests but if you read his powerpoints verbatim then you should be fine. Study for the quizzes because those are easy points and do well in lab!
"The things that I could say about this woman. I could go on for days. Probably a great nurse in the field, but absolutely neurotic in class. Reads straight from slides; classes are a foray into nightmarish levels of boredom. Tests are a mess of questions pulled from thin air, and you are always guilty of cheating until proven innocent. Seriously."
"You can tell that she definitely knows what she is talking about, but lecture is ridiculously long and boring. She goes off on random tangents and many lectures she only goes over 10 or 11 slides because she is so long winded. Tests are hard, but they prepare you for NCLEX. I thought the paper was the toughest as she is an APA format freak."
"Test day is a nightmare. She is very concerned with making sure it is done 100% correct, which is fine, but she can come across as very rude about it. She touched my arm and lifted my sleeve to look for a watch. The tests weren\'t that bad honestly. The paper was more difficult for me. She is very specific about APA format, so be careful with that."
"Ida seems like a great nurse don\'t get me wrong, however, her class sucks. Her tests are ridiculously hard and her lectures are extremely boring. She reads straight off the powerpoint so I could\'ve not even shown up for class but had to. The exams are all definitions of basically the same words. I hate that this class is a pre-nursing class."
"These pre-nursing classes were the reason I decided nursing was not for me. Your grade is dependent almost entirely on 2 exams and a final. The tests are ridiculous with definitions and random questions over APA format and god knows what. She walks around, and stands over you while you test. She is the only option, but I would not recommend."
"You can tell from class that Dr. Slusher is definitely a good nurse and knows the information she is teaching. However, she is very tough to please in class. Her tests are the hardest out of the pre-nursing classes. All the answers can be right, but you have to pick the one that is the most right. You definitely have to work for your grade."
"Ida... you can tell she is an amazing nurse and an even better woman. You can tell outside of class she is very nice... but in class is different. During exams she puts tissues in your face, takes your jacket, and once made me move my arm because I guess I could be cheating??? The class is hard, dont get me wrong, but it is definitely doable. STUDY"
"As this professor was the only professor teaching the course, I had no option but to take her class. She seems to mean well and I\'m sure she is well respected in the Nursing world, but it was impossible to meet with her one on one and she failed to email me back a few times. Be prepared to study and pay attention in class or you will not pass."
"Dr. Slusher wouldn\'t accept a hand written love letter from Channing Tatum if it wasn\'t APA format. She is crazy for the rules and reads the PowerPoint word by word everyday (good luck dealing with her voice). Tests are common sense, but difficult because there are 3 right answers but you need to pick the \'best\' one"
"Professor Brown is all over the place. When being assigned essays and such, we were never given a concrete answer of due dates or when an assignment was due. 95% of the time, the class was confused. No note taking, only watching YouTube videos and being tested on handouts. I didn\'t enjoy this class in the slightest."
"Definitely take her class for ENG 095. As long as you attend class, do your work and polite to her, she will love you. Papers are only a page long and your final is a group project. Easy A"
"Dr. Brown is one of the most passionate professors I have ever had. She loves modernism and postmodernism and it shows! I learned so much and was able to apply what I learned in other courses. It was a fun, easy class and I would highly recommend taking a course with Dr. Brown."
"Dr. Brown is one of the best professors I have ever had. This course truly feels like what you might expect for an elective -fun, simple, and engaging. All of the writing comes from your heart (no outside research is necessary). I had her for both Postmodernism and Modernism, but you don\'t need to take Modernism for Postmodernism. I recommend."
He has you discover the chemistry. This has you understand why the rules are the way the rules are and understand why things work the way they do.
"Dr. Horn has a very unique teaching style. In short he doesn\'t really teach. Everything you need to know will come from the textbook, the in-class activities will just confuse you and waste your time. His tests are super vague and hardly reflect what was learned. This class does not prepare you for later chemistry courses. Find another teacher."
Literally the worst teacher I\'ve ever had! Do not take his class!!!! The average on every test was below a 65 percent. I studied everyday for at least 2 hours. The tests aren\'t relevant to anything you learn in class. He doesn\'t teach you anything. I ended up with a 79.82 percent in the class and he wouldn\'t round up to a B- for me.

"Do not take him! He is more worried about his ""group study"" than the students. The average on the final was 65% and that is considering the curve! I ended up with around 85% on the final, and I ended with a B. The tests are only 15 question each so if you miss 3 your already below 80%. He lectured for a total of a couple hours in the semester."
"Prof. Horn\'s class is extremely difficult. Group work every single day. Daily assignments can be confusing at times. Exams are super frustrating and hard. The worst exam set up I\'ve experienced at UVU. He seems super unapproachable in class. That being said, one on one, he is one of the nicest dudes. You can go to him and he will help you out."
"He is a great teacher, when he teaches! Which is not very often. He knows the subject very well and is passionate about it . However he hardly lectures. The first day of the semester he sticks you in groups and you better hope you get a good group because you will be each others teachers for the semester."
"Do yourself a huge favor & don\'t choose Richards. She is extremely unorganized in her lectures & rambles about nonsense for the first 25 min of the class, and then expects you to have actually learned something. Class is out of 100 pts, w pop quizzes worth 8, & the final paper (which you put hours and hours into) worth 15... makes no sense. Unfair"
"Do not take! If you must: play nice, learn 2 names, dates, important events, and basic bio of assigned person. Ignore all assigned reading: exam Q\'s given one week in advance, plenty to time to prep if you are strong student. Do not skip class but you will want to! Pop quiz, term paper, exams: respond to each sentence of question, be specific!"
"I took her African American history class in USF. Dr. Richards is a great professor. She taught history in Afrocentric perspective. She cares about her students very much. Be aware of the pop quizzes. For midterm and final exams, if you put works on it and do what she asks you to do , you will definitely get a good grades."
"I love this professor, she is passionate about the subject and tries her best to get you interested as well, tests are easy, quizes everyweek but you can use your notes, there is alot of homework but they count alot for your grade. Take her, you wont regret it, she\'s the sweetest prof at chaffey."
"Eisberg is AMAZING. Very enthusiastic and easy going professor and is always available to help. She tends to ramble though, she\'ll spend 20 minutes answering a yes or no question but I\'d take her again. As long as you go to class and do the homework and online quizzes you\'ll pass and there\'s a few extra credit opportunities."
"Professor Eisberg is a great professor. She\'s super enthusiastic about astronomy and very helpful. There is homework pretty much every week, you should be prepared to dedicate a few hours to that (basically twice the length of the online lecture). Lots of assignments, but they\'re easy and are all completed in class."
Eisberg is awesome. Hardest class I\'ve taken but so incredibly worth it. She is passionate about what she teaches. She is there for assistance if you need it. She wants to help the students. I loved the content. I would totally recommend her!
"Joann is great. She really wants all her students to succeed and is always available to help you out if you have any questions. She taught a flipped instruction course which required a lot of studyingonline lectures for homework, but her lectures class activities always make the material easy to understand. Love her!"
Easy A. So easy I didn\'t learn much. Participate and get an A.
Maria was the sweetest professor I have ever had. She was super flexible and understands that life happens sometimes. Sometimes was not super clear about criteria. But was fairly assessable outside of the classroom. Absolutely adored her and wished I wasn\'t done with my psych requirements to take more classes with her ! I took her at the RCC Campus
she\'s great. wants you to succeed. will help you if you ask for extra credit. very good lectures and good study guides. I\'ve followed her for my bio major prereqs. she likes you to be involved in discussion on the topics on the subjects of the day. love the team group testing gives the chance to build up grade. She\'s best teach ever for psych.
Great professor! Must rent textbook to receive participation points on the online discussions b/c participation grade weighs a lot. She likes to know you are reading the assignments and quoting from the actual book. She does offer extra credit via essay. Only need to write 2 essays for online class APA style. Great at replying back to emails
I love mrs Fitzpatrick psych 25. She\'s very caring a bit of a calling in sick but if you voice your concerns to her she will help you pick up grade. She\'s funny. her tests do match her 3 exams. a lot of reading. she lets you use a cheat sheet on test easy A. very accessible on line and in office. she\'s overall very relaxed happy all the time.
"Most lectures are half lecture half movie, not very specific on what you need to be paying attention to. Beware, she will not reply back to your emails. Feedback for our research paper rough draft was given back to us 3 days before the final draft was due. She makes you take all the tests twice for a ""chance"" to do better but, its not worth it. :("
She took over the 2nd half of my socialpsych class. I had her for intro to psych and it was a waste of time. Her classes are why millenials think they\'re owed something. Write all your answers on her allowed cheat sheets and do assignments and you get an A+. If felt like an insult to the students who actually want to be challenged and EARN grades.
"her lecture is really boring, she use a lot of boring video, long long time ago information. she offer a lot extra credit, if you did them you will get a good grade. it is hard to learning something through her lecture."
Her online Psych 25 class was the easiest class I\'ve ever taken! Her quizzes aren\'t timed and you have all semester for homework assignments. Definitely recommend this class if you are working full time and don\'t really have time for homework.
Professor Fitzpatrick is awesome and really pretty. She really knows her stuff for all of her psych classes. She emails fast and answers all of your questions. I definitely recommend taking her for all of your psych classes.
"One of the best classes I\'ve taken. I took this class online over the summer. There are weekly forum posts and quizzes. One final and two papers. She is easy to talk to and is always willing to help. There was a lot of reading, but it was easy reading cause it is all very interesting. Take her! You won\'t regret it."
"She\'s a great professor and her class is interesting. She offers a cheat sheet for every exam only because her tests are pretty difficult. She is a fair grader, however, she takes APA format very serious. If you make any mistakes on an APA format assignment, she will take many points off. Other than that, she\'s very clear. Offers extra credit."
"Dr Tjandra is a very smart professor , he definatley provides you the recourses to well in his class. Practice the hw problems as many times as possible and focus on the material he emphasizes in lecture. Dont fall behind because it will punch you in the face the deeper you get into the course. He drops lowest test and has weekly quizzes."
"Professor Tjandra was great! He explains everything thoroughly and in an easy way to try to remember. It is a lot of work, includes homework assignments, exercise worksheets, quizzes, tests, and lab work. I however did not put my full effort so i will probably be failing the class but will retake him soon after because he really is great."
I had absolutely no chemistry background but professor Tjandra gives really good examples so the material is understandable. There is a lot of work for this class but it\'s good practice for the test.
"Professor Tjandra is amazing! I never thought I would be so intrigued by Chemistry. He really had me enjoy coming to class, which is a first. He definitely wants to make sure you understand everything and uses great examples. Take him!!"
He was the first science professor I had at Chaffey college. He was amazing. I had never taken chemistry previously and I passed his class with an A. He gives lots of hand outs that really help with understanding and does a lot of in class activities. I would recommend him. I wish he tought 24A and 24B
Need to show up to class. She gives random participation days and takes attendance every day. Reports are easy as long as you skim the material.
"I absolutely loved this class. I showed up for every class session. You have to unless you have a friend who is willing to give you the notes since she does not post powerpoints online. She goes in depth and you actually learn the subject matter. The tests are literally based on the notes and questions from the study guide. Overall, she is great!"
She seemed a little nutty at times but she\'s super caring and sweet. I didn\'t pay attention in her class and still managed to get an A.
Prof. Spears is by far the BEST professor/instructor/teacher I have had in my entire University experience. He was always so excited to start the lecture and actually cares about what he is teaching students. I\'ve taken two classes with him already and plan on taking any more that I can in my last year. Highly recommend taking any class he teaches
"Hilarious that people complain about the amount of readings in 4340. It\'s a FULL credit course. What did u expect? Gives away 20% of ur mark in weekly quizzes/participation. Much less writing than other full credits(3 essays, 18 pages total). Tough marker for essays, but fair & gives good feedback. Great course, fav prof,interesting, learned a lot."
"Did not enjoy the lectures, they were clear but I feel that he spent too much time on every idea thus we ran out of time occasionally and it could get boring. He can call on students at random so be aware of being put on the spot. Instructions for our essay were very open-ended and this made it much more difficult. He is a nice guy though for sure!"
"he is a very tough prof, probably the toughest I have ever had but he is by far my favorite. he is a hard marker for essays and has high expectations, but It makes you a better student. He is great to just chat with about issues in class. Overall amazing guy. Totally possible to get 80+ if you hustle all year."
"He\'s a great guy. Just impossible to get 80+ in. Class average will be around a low 70 no matter what. You will get no higher than a 75 on the term paper. He\'s an amazing lecturer, that\'s it. Final is extremely difficult too."
Ridiculous amount of readings for a fourth year class. It seems like its a Masters class but isnt. I barely got a 68 because it was so damn difficult to keep up. Hes a really nice guy but marks really hard and expects too much.
Absolutely ridiculous class. 100 pages of reading per week and the professor marks incredibly difficult. Hes a nice guy and you learn a lot but do not expect a 75+.
Spears was an amazing prof! He genuinely cares about the students and tries to remember the names of all of the students in order to develop a more personal relationship. He\'ll go out of his way to help you and definitely makes lectures interesting. He\'s always up for a discussion during class which allows students to gain more knowledge.
"8:30AM 3 hour seminar. Quiz every class. 100+ pages of reading/week. Tough marker. That all being said, it was genuinely a privilege to be in Ian Spears 4th year class. It is the most eye opening, provocative and inspirational course at Guelph. He cares about his students and wants them to think critically about every reading. Take this class."
Spears is a really great prof! His course is very focused on the readings but he lectures very well and is really funny.
"Spears is one of those profs that has an almost legendary reputation among students. He\'s incredibly engaging, friendly, intelligent, and helpful. His classes are not easy. The readings are fairly long, but interesting. He expects high-quality essays, and his examinations require thorough knowledge of all the readings. And yet you\'ll still love it."
"One of my favourite professors at Guelph. He truly makes lectures enjoyable to attend. I believe he is an extremely fair marker and creates good exams, but his classes are not easy."
Spears is amazing. Super passionate about what he does and encourages each pupil to have their own opinion. Really values your participation in class and likes to show you ALL perspectives in order to equip you for the actual world where there is no one answer to anything. Absolute favourite prof at UofG.
"Many call him Ian ""the ratface"" spears"
"Very easy class. Easy grader, easy tests, you\'ll be fine if you skip here and there. All you gotta do is study the given study guides and you\'ll pass easily. We had 2 papers and you don\'t even have to try and you\'ll get a good grade. Highly recommend. ART 200"
"Professor Sweely is one of my absolute favorite human beings. She is so full of knowledge and you can tell she loves her job. She even makes lectures about thousand year old art interesting. The only down fall of the class is that there are only about 5 grades for the whole year, so you must do well on all of them. Relatively easy A."
"Dr. Sweely is my favorite professor so far; she\'s my hero! Although it\'s a writing intensive course, there are only 2 short papers, 3 tests, and a 2-minute presentation. There is a textbook but I never felt the need to use it, and found a free pdf of it online. Take every class you can with her!"
"My absolute favorite professor at EKU. She is incredibly kind and caring towards her students, will always make time outside of class and welcomes questions. She is extremely well versed and knowledgable in her subject. Dr. Sweely by far has had the most impact in my academic career. It was an absolute joy to have her as a professor!"
"Gay is a wonderful professor! I have taken her for two courses (ARH 390W and ARH 498). Each course consists of 2 papers and 3-4 Image Exams. Class consists of her opening with a fun video and lecturing with a PowerPoint. No notes need to be taken, she practically gives you the exam on the study guide. Great class and great professor!"
"Loved this class! Lectures were boring sometimes, but it was an interesting class. Gay really loves teaching it, she will repeat that a lot. It is an easy class, not many assignments and the exams are all memorization. Would recommend! Easy A!"
She is the best. She is easy and funny. It s really easy to get an A in this class. There are 2 homework in this class and one project they r easy to do. There r 2 tests and she gives u the study guide for them. I highly recommend her
"Dr. Fisher is really funny. He\'s undoubtedly very knowledgable, but he lectures EXTREMELY fast. I recommend rewatching Tegrity for his lectures, because he often elaborates on his slideshows & says things that\'re not written down but that he will test you on. On the tests, he usually never takes questions directly from his HW, he rewords them"
"Not too shabby, enjoyed him"
You can tell he is passionate about teaching and his lectures are highly educational. He throws in funny remarks during his lectures to keep class interesting. Use his homework as a way to keep track of what to study. He also gives out old tests with answer keys before each exam.
"Dr. Fisher is super chill guy and his lectures are easy to pay attention. However, his tests are super detail oriented and have lots of small things. All in all though, I would definitely take his class again."
"Dr. Fisher was a great professor. I liked his lectures, he tried to keep it interesting, and sometimes he\'ll share a scrap of his personal life. He tries to answer any questions during a lecture. I never used office hours, but I knew they were available. His tests aren\'t bad compared to other bio professors. Bio is just a hard course overall."
"This dude is incredibly well-spoken and humble. He never talks down to his students and always respects their views. He makes the class a very chill experience, and as long as you do the inquisitives, you will definitely pass. In terms of the tests, he lets you use an index card and I\'d recommend just writing timeline, so you can nail chronology."
Just keep up with your work and you will be fine
"He is someone who I\'d call an intellectual. I could just sit down and listen to him talk about things he\'s passionate about. Very smart, funny, and gives great lectures. If you turn in a paper he marks grammatical errors and work cited mistakes. take good notes and refer to the book. You have to work for your grade but he makes it very enjoyable."
James is a fantastic teacher. If you bomb the midterm or final it will not kill you. The inquizzitives he gives are impossible to fail and are an easy A. He is heavy on reading. The debates he gives are fantastic and another easy A. I would definitely take him again!
His lectures are engaging. Best professor at Coastal. Prepares you for the exams by making the course fun and interesting.
"Dr. James, At first I was hesitant to take his class as I signed up for another professor but the class was split due to size. I am very glad I had Dr. James. His tests are long and he is a little disorganized at times but his lectures are fun and he is very passionate about history. Will make you work for your grade! Overall I really liked him."
"Even if you follow his feedback, it doesn\'t help future grades. Unnecessarily harsh in general communication. That being said, all work was online, didn\'t have to go to campus for anything so that\'s a huge plus. If it weren\'t for the feedback issues and his attitude toward students, I\'d rate higher and consider taking again. Tough but doable."
"Almost finished with my BA in History, I really like to reflect upon my history class with Prof. Timmons. He is tough, but you will rarely find another Prof. as knowledgeable. I would recommend him to anyone who is serious about history or, simply enjoys actual learning and is not afraid to work for it!"
The lectures are pretty mediocre and there\'s a heavy workload for a 3 credit hour class. Your final grade is basically how much time you spent outside of class so it\'s 100% possible to get an A if you\'re willing to put in the time. If you\'re not a history buff and just looking to get a gen ed requirement I suggest you look elsewhere
"Solid professor for the most part. Homework load is insane if you have other heavy courses. If you love to read and write take his class. He can be a bit arrogant at times, but he is very qualified and knows his stuff. Do not fall behind on journal or review question assignments if possible. You will get an A if you work hard for it."
I would recommend him. Expect homework but it\'s very manageable. If you do the work you should be able to easily pass. He is upfront about what quizzes are over and midtermsfinal.
"The content covered is very interesting, but the way that she tests you over it is not. Instead of testing over the themes of literature and the impact they had on history, you are expected to be able to identify direct quotes. There were only 4-5 grades for the whole semester and one of those was a group project."
American Literature after 1865 is the second of two classes I took with Professor Lape this summer. I greatly enjoyed this class because she helped me grow as a writer. I especially like how she lets students pick the topics of their essays (related to the assigned readings and approved by her). I would reccomend that anyone take a class with her.
"I took two online classes with Professor Lape this summer, and I wish I could take more. I greatly enjoyed this class covering women\'s literature. Participation is in the form of Blackboard posts covering that week\'s readings. Papers are returned (with great feedback) within a few days of submission. I became better writer because of her."
"Professor Lape is such a sweet lady. She helps you understand the readings the next day you come into class by discussing with everyone. There are not many grades. Attendance does matter to her. There\'s one group project which could go either way based on the group you choose to be with. The exams are a little rough to study for, but you do well."
"Gives very vague instruction, assigns a ton of reading you\'ll have to recognize specific quotations from for exams, very unorganized, wish I would have dropped the class."
I loved this class. Dr lape does give test but they\'re easy if you read the readings. I read half the readings and kept up on the weeklies she post which summarized each ready and writer. USE THE WEEKLIES FOR THE TEST!!!!! easy to pass if you can readwrite english.
"Very very specific about what he wants out of your assignments. Needs you to pander to his own views to do well in the class, leaving not much room for originality and outside perspectives."
"The 199 courses are great for breath requirements, and this course was no exception. It was a very fun course. There were only a few papers and one take home test. As long as you gave a solid effort on each assignment it was not hard to get a high mark. The material of the course is also very eye opening."
"Really arrogant, and just annoying. Really easy to get a good grade even though he\'s nit-picky."
"Really open to student\'s ideas, even when he didn\'t agree with them he accepted their merit. Really funny and used real world connections to make class interesting."
"I LOVED Lesk\'s sex in the city class- would highly recommend this first year seminar. The material and field trips were very interesting and Lesk clearly knew a lot about the subject matter and added a lot to the overall experience. Sometimes it was hard to tell what kind of mood he was in which was scary, but for the most part he\'s a fun prof."
"Dr. Spock was very good at giving lectures, but the course load is insane. I\'m talking three or four assignments due every week. This was a general education course for me, but this was the class I spent the majority of my time studying and doing homework for. It is a very difficult class and you will not pass without effort. I would NOT recommend"
"I loved Dr. Spock! Her class is probably one of the harder ones that I\'m currently taking, but she gives LOTS of extra credit and is always ready to help. You will do more writing than you might like, but she gives good feedback. Lots of reading, lots of class participation. It\'s a tough class for a gen ed, but I would definitely take her again"
"You have to attend class to understand what she makes you read. She lives, breathes and bleeds Russia. Shes a great person and i like her as a person, but as a professor; no thank you."
best chem professor for 150 easily. tests are harder than the other professors but she\'s such a good lecturer that it offsets it. she also provides the opportunity for a 5 point bonus each test that helps a lot. you have to work but she makes it worth it.
Mcgill is going to be a hit or miss for all of her students. Her style was very much pose a question and watch students struggle even if they were going in the wrong direction before explaining the right answer. AKA very roundabout in her teaching. If you take her I highly recommend getting notes from students who have already taken the class
One of my favorite professors at Emory. Really awesome lectures that I actually enjoyed going to and fair albeit difficult tests.
"Chem is hard to begin with, but McGill teaches it well. She doesn\'t have the traditional powerpoint with bulletpoints, so you\'re really going to have to do her worksheets and pay attention. Do all resources given(chem mentors, office hours etc) I had friends in Heaven who had basically the same test as us, but they never really learned the material"
"Chem is difficult but doable. Use all resources: office hours, EPASS, Chem Mentors. Great lecturer. Kind person. Helpful at answering questions. Enthusiastic."
"She is a really good lecturer, but she goes so fast; it\'s hard to grasp the concepts if you have no time to process, so I wish she recorded her lectures or something. Her tests are pretty hard, so if you want to a good GPA go take another professor. Other professors are relatively easier."
"She\'s really nice and gives good lectures, but she gives really hard tests that will kill your GPA."
Exhibits a genuine love for Chemistry and cares so much for her students! And she\'s Canadian so you\'ll learn a lot about that if you take her class. It\'s a definite PLUS!
She\'s amazing. Really helps you understand the concepts of general chemistry with a little bit of organic mixed in. She made me a chemistry major! Go to chem mentors and do the class worksheets and it\'s not hard to get an A.
"Dr. McGill is very sweet and willing to help if needed. Her office hours are very helpful. The content is difficult but reading and chem mentors really helps. For fall 2017, McGill and Williams will be the only ones with experience teaching the new course, Chem 150, so take them!"
I had Dr. McGill for Chemistry 141 and 142 and her courses this year were the pilot courses for the new Chemistry 150 and 2nd semester course. She did an amazing job of creating the new curriculum and taught it amazingly. She cares so much about her students and was so helpful during office hours. Take her if you want a good grade!
She was an amazing professor who really took time to listen to her students. The class will require reading and includes a lot of organic chemistry as this semester she taught the pilot curriculum which is becoming the new Chemistry 150. It is a lot more focused on fewer topics and will help to prepare students for Organic Chemistry for sure!
Dr. McGill is very nice but her class can be very challenging. She offers extra credit for groups if the group average is above an 80. The class consists mostly of group work on worksheets rather than actual lecture. It was sometimes unclear what chapters we should be reading. Generally we ran out of time before we could go over worksheets.
"quick 2 question quiz every friday. 15% of your grade is participation!!!! Dont bother buying the textbook, I never opened mine!!!! For any open ended question he asks in class, answer ""IT DEPENDS"". 99% of the time you\'ll be right! midterm and final are questions very similar to the quizes! Take clear notes!"
"No textbook necessary for this class. Ghorashi lectures the entire class which can be boring but he is very clear and always asks if everyone understands because all test and quizzes are based on notes taken during lecture. He revisits previous lessons at the beginning of class. A quiz every week, midterm, and final, rarely any homework."
"Ghorashi was perfect for Micro. I can see why his other courses may be more difficult but he taught micro excellently. He is passionate, very worldly and knowledgeable. I was I had been on time and attended better because he takes self phone use and attendance very seriously. He is hilarious and committed to making sure you understand the subject."
"Such an amazing professor. Related everything to the real world, and really engages his students with his humor and animated way of lecturing. He always makes sure everyone understands each lesson & will go over everything as many times as needed to help you. Take good notes and review for quizzes and you will do great!"
Dr. Thielen was extremely intelligent and provided us with all the materials required to pass the class. His lectures were also thought provoking and entertaining.
"I took this class as a hybrid class and really enjoyed it. The class consists mostly of reading through the teachers slide shows and writing down information on a paper you could use on tests, which took a lot of time but helped me really succeed in the class. The teacher was very nice also!"
"Professor Thielen is a good teacher and just a good person in general, his lectures are interesting and he cares about his students. There was a lot of reading and homework but I was in his hybrid class. Show up, do the homework and study for the tests and you\'ll do great."
"Dr. Thielen is awesome. He does such a good job at engaging the students in interpersonal comm. He gives you every opportunity to make up lost points with multiple extra credit options. If you don\'t do the work you won\'t pass but you will have ample time to do it and its very easy work. I would take this class again, thats how good it was."
Dr Thielen is a true gem at Pvcc! Took his interpersonal communication class and it was amazing. His lectures are interesting and he wants you to participate. He is very clear and appreciates his students\' hard work! Would defedentley take his class again!
"His class is very fun! Took his hybrid class, so we met once a week. All the material was online on canvas. He gives a notetaking guide that correlates to each slide in his presentations and you can use that cheat sheet on the exams! You can also fill the margins with extra notes and it\'s okay. Loved his class :)"
"I had him once a week for trig at night, it was not a good time, but he made the class lively. You really have to work for a good grade but he gives easy and useful extra credit, it isn\'t much but it could bring your test up a letter grade. Loves interacting with his students, will 100% talk to you at least once."
Very great teacher. Hes goofy and out there which is different from the average teacher. He makes up funny sayings and tries his best to relate math with real world examples. I was never bored in his class. He picks on everyone so beware and pay attention at all times. I would definitely recommend him. I wish I could take him for Stats.
"Young is amazing! I suck at math but I got an A in this class (after getting a C in intermediate algebra which was taken online with an instructor that didn\'t always respond to requests for help in time for the test). For me, the A took quite a bit of intense work. Generous extra credit and fabulous DIY lecture videos were very much appreciated!"
"I\'ve always been bad at math and after failing college algebra the first time I never thought I\'d be able to pass this class. Bob Young cares about students and offers extra credit, amazing study tools online and in person, and other helpful tips throughout. Without his hilarious and effective teaching methods I wouldn\'t of passed this class."
"I am terrible at math, yet I finished this course with an A. This was an online course - all assignments were open from day 1 of the semester so that students could work ahead. Extra credit opportunities for every tests. Professor Young WANTS his students to succeed. If you struggle in math, he will get you through!"
"I did not know what to expect going into this course however, Mr. Young did an outstanding job utilizing Canvas and MYMathLab to give his students a clear expectation even before stepping into his class. There are plenty of resources available, I am not the most confident student in math but he brings of the best in his students. Take his class!!!!"
"Professor Young is amazing! I have always had a hard time with algebra, I made a C in pre algebra even! I dropped college algebra three times before finding professor Young. He speaks math to where I can actually understand it. Couldn\'t find a better math teacher!"
I took Mr. Young for College Trigonometry. You can tell right away that he really loves math and he really loves teaching. Trigonometry isn\'t easy for a lot of students but he really tries his best to explain everything as best he can. I\'ve now moved on to Calculus and the fundamentals he taught are helping out a ton!
"I\'m horrible at math. I had to take all of the development classes and barely passed those. Professor Young is the best math teacher I have ever had. Yes, I made an effort to learn the material but he really breaks down everything and never makes you feel stupid for not knowing/remembering a concept. TAKE HIM IF YOU STRUGGLE WITH ANY TYPE OF MATH"
"Prof Leatham teaches in a way in which you learn or you don\'t. From the very beginning he makes it known you control your own grade. Lots to read but most readings are interesting. His style is relaxed, honest, invigorating, and he\'s most definitely a giver. Pays close attention to detail and is forgiving of fault. Hands down, def one of the best."
"Professor Leatham is a very unique professor, I enjoyed his class very much. A lot of reading, lectures were always interesting and very good. He doesn\'t baby anyone and gets you ready for the real world. He tries to get you to really use your mind. He breaks the paradigm of professor in a great way. Too many complainers in his class."
"really enjoyed this class. His lectures are messy but be an adult and organize the information to how it makes sense to you. Go to office hours for any extra help, he is really a sweet man and very excited to teach."
"A student and 2 year assistant. I know WBL. Positive: Dr. Leatham offers passable classes. Minimal effort decent grade. Knowledgeable. Online reading and exercises mandatory. Negative: Egomaniac. Avoids questions. Lectures off-topic. Often late. Humor, problematic when the focus is personal. Be careful what you say. It will be remembered."
"His test have nothing to do with what he leactures about (if you can call it lecturing). Our final was about 112 question long. He tries to ""Stand and Deliver"" the class, but fails miserably. There is no organization! This class is not hard, but it adds so much stress to your life. You\'re basically in limbo the whole time with your grade. Stay away"
"All he does is yell at us. I am a Bio Chem student in Calc 2 & obviously am good at studying and following the rules, but he makes the class so much harder. Just finished his class and I am still confused at what he actually taught. He is jumbled on his exams (2 number 49\'s on a scantron - not sure which one to answer) and he updates nothing."
Why were most of the recent bad reviews deleted? Bruce is probs reporting all these lol
"Unreasonably hard exam, fun fact, rivers macro econ filled up right after Hammond\'s final exam."
"I had Hammond for Micro in fall term 2016 and Macro in winter term 2017. I thought he was a good prof and was able to get good marks in both classes. However, after a year, it looks like that has all changed as I was reading all the comments for the fall 2017 micro term. Just goes to show how classes/profs can differ year to year. Just be careful"
Really enjoyable prof! Loved attending lectures and exams were really easy
Ive been doing the same lmao
Funny thing that everyone is complaining about him this year. I definitely agree based on my experience in first year; he is indeed heartless and does not care about his students.
"Litterly studied so hard, and the final didn\'t make any logical sense. Most of the questions were concepts that have never even been relayed in lectures or the textbook. it was almost as if I wrote a completely different course exam that I KNEW nothing about. guessed every question. cried during it; brutal experience."
She does care about her students I can give her that. The only problem is she goes way too fast with lectures and it\'s a difficult time trying to understand the problems when she immediately moves on to the next. How are we supposed to learn from that? Every other week she gives a quiz and I think we should go over the problems more before.
"Amazing professor! FIN 301 is a difficult class but she explains everything so well, you barely need to go over it in the textbook. She is very accessible outside of class and will see you at any time you need! Tests are difficult but she scales them and she gives you extra credit. She takes pride when you do well in her class!"
"Was definitely a hard class, but you will learn a lot. She teaches at a fast pace and takes attendance every class. Assigns a lot of homework but doesn\'t check it until the end of the semester for extra credit. You will need the textbook. she assigns homework from it and quizzes us on chapter reading for participation points"
"She is tough, wants you to participate to help you understand Finance. She really cares about you learning and getting something out of class. Last semester she started using online resources which made some of the homework easier."
"Professor Luther is one of the best Business professors Salem State University, if not the best. She personalizes her teaching to suit each class and individually each student. The information I received from Professor Luther is unmatched by any professor. She helped me get the information I needed to get an internship and is not my advisor."
She is one of those professors that expects you to fully understand a concept after one explanation of it. The way she explains things is very vague and confusing. She needs to find a different approach because the way she does thing\'s now just isn\'t cutting it. Please do yourself a favor and try and find a different professor.
I took Kathy\'s photography class in 2000/2001. She was excellent at motivating individuals with photographic art. I wasn\'t the best photographer but I did enjoy the projects and they surprisingly came out well. I always admired my classmates and their creativity with her projects. She was excellent - Thanks Kathy
"Throughout the class I was able to learn about different photography techniques I had no idea about. Important to mention, Haddad is a very hilarious instructor and easy to connect with."
"Kathy is a very laid-back type of professor. Attendance is usually not mandatory as long as you do put in the work. She does have very unorthodox approaches to assignments and projects and the medium in which she bestows it on her students. However, there is method to her madness, and I do feel like I retain info from her classes."
"One of my favorite professors! I have had her for Photo 7 and 9, and am waiting to take 50. She is passionate about her craft, talented and loves teaching. She doesn\'t take herself too seriously and is great fun! Her classes are work with lots of info, but she uses a variety of media to teach it. Quizzes can be tricky."
"Kathy is so much fun. But if you want to do well you much keep up and do your assignments on time. There is a lot of Internet videos to watch, many with her in them. They are a crack up, but you do learn a lot from them. Lots of work, but it is always fun. She is a great teacher."
Kathy is an amzing professor. She cares about her students but participation is a must. Following directions is key to this class and it is an easy A if you do what is required. She gives feedback and if you follow it you will succeed. I would take her class again in a minute.
"He\'s probably the best professor I\'ve had. He really cares about his students and really prides in his lectures. In addition, his lectures are all available online just for anyone to use. The assignments he gave were easy, all you really need to do is attend his classes and you\'re all set. Plus his stories are great. His final was easy. Take it!"
"Great professor and has interesting lectures. Although he lacks group projects and even though his lectures are interesting, if you don\'t love listening to lectures they can get kinda boring. TIP: for the test, go to his lecture notes on canvas and hit Ctrl+F on your keyboard. It\'s an open test so you can do word search on notes to get the answers."
"Lectures can get a bit boring, but he adds in really amusing stories about his life to help lighten things up. Minimal homework; super short, easy essays due every week on Canvas and a final exam. Lots of extra credit opportunities."
"David is a good teacher. He knows how to make the subject sound interesting, no matter what it is. He also has really good stories to tell. If you have an opportunity to take a class with him, do it. You won\'t regret it. The only homework he assigns is reading 1-3 chapters a week and a weekly online discussion. The final was open book, open note."
"Hyde is probably my favorite professor at SPSCC. He\'s interesting, engaging, and knows what the hell he\'s talking about. His stories spice up his lectures and the information he shares is really interesting. I learned more in the classes I took with Hyde than in any other classes. And it was incredibly easy. If you\'re on the fence, do it."
Professor Potter is THE best sociology instructor. He genuinely cares if you\'re understanding the material and is more than willing to help. Lectures were quick and informative. His one-line jokes are an added bonus. Definitely take Professor Potter if you have the chance!
"This class was really easy! Potter is an easy teacher and there was hardly any work for the class, the only downside is you can\'t see your grade because he doesn\'t use Canvas but you can always ask for it!"
"Boomin\' voice and great enunciation. Lectures at a good rate- not too fast & not too slow. Willing to always repeat himself to make sure you get the notes down. Very caring and approachable. Gives study guides and preps you well for the exams. Lectures are precise, but it\'s better to read the book too when studying for tests. BEST TEACHER EVER!"
He\'s honestly the best teacher out there. I am so glad I took him. His grading is pretty easy as well. He does try to help his students out by giving a practice test before the actual test. Hes a very understanding and wonderful teacher.
"lectures can seem a bit out of date and somewhat boring, but he cares about his students and he really tries to make it easy for everyone. Class attendance and the oral presentation are gifts from him to you. Easiest 20% of the grade. Just show up! Goes over everything that will be in exams! class paper is easy, just follow the outline. no hmwrk"
"Took him in the summer and he was ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL. His grades are based on: attendance, oral presentation, 1 midterm w/ essay, and 1 final w/essay. Essay prompts are given 1 week in advance to prepare for. GO TO CLASS!! His exams are based on lectures. The book is helpful, not necessary. Loved his laugh and his personality. 3"
"He\'s a really good teacher. Tests are just the midterm and final; he gives you study guide and practice with the class before the test and there is an essay question for the test, he gives you the prompt so you can be prepared. Individual presentation is 10%. He just gives you a question and you have to find it in the book and present it in class."
"I learned so much in this class. Potter is a VERY CLEAR professor, and is always there for students. I can\'t stress how much information I retained after taking this class. I highly recommend taking this class."
"Dr. Dogru was a good professor in my opinion. She gave very tough tests, but was always fair. The class consists mostly of her handing out packets of the material and were expected to work on it with a group. She walks around and if you got stuck, she could explain it many different ways. She is a very smart woman and rather challenging."
"Dr. Dogru always had well planned out packets to give us. However, we basically had to learn the material in groups before she would teach us how to do it. She was very sweet and was always available for office hours. She didn\'t put homework grades in until the end so I thought I was getting a C when I really ended up with an A-."
"Take her! She gives a few concept notes and examples on the board. Point out a mistake and she is cool about it. Mostly work on handouts with people you sit with while she walks around and helps. Her teaching style is to let you figure things out while she guides you. Few graded homeworks. She has a Turkish accent, but is very understandable."
"I really liked Prof. Dogru and enjoyed her class. Her quizzes were not too hard and as long as you payed attention, did your homework, and tried you would do well! When you don\'t understand something, just ask! She is always willing to change her ways and explain in a way that may make more sense to her students."
"She teaches really good, her exams were based off everything she teaches. I did not understand math and she made it so simple. My only issue is class attendance. I missed class once and was not able to make up her work even though I had an injury. Five points from an ""A"". SKIP CLASS YOU WON\'T PASS. Also beware of group work."
This class is really easy does require access code for hw
Easy work attendance matter because pop quizzes can happen which are open notes and she\'s caring a real darling
"Very nice, easy class."
"In a history of math classes I\'ve taken Ive never actually received A\'s of any of my test. She even gave us candy ,DO the extra credit trust me it helps!"
"Best math professor I\'ve ever had in my life! She\'s truly a gem. Nicest person ever, she actually cares about her students, gives extra credit."
"Definitely not my favorite prof. Learned more/better on mathlab then in class, because Im not too good at math and her teaching style wasn\'t good to me. if your already good youll do well but if not make sure you teach and prepare yourself and study in groups. lots of homework online before test, 4 tests and she gives lots of extra credit. STUDY!!!"
"This is the thing. Her class is so easy that it\'s boring. Also, if you are into meditating, this is your class (weird, I know). Lectures are on the internet; you take daily (EASY) quizzes, and work in teams for extra credit. The tests are the study guide (FANSTATIC), and she CARES. But she is not for people that have no patience."
Professor Espana teaching methods were some of the best methods I received at MDC. Provide extra credit and want to pass students
I love her I wish she taught all maths coming from a non math liker but take advantage of extra credit and you should pass TAKE HER TAKE HER TAKE HER it\'s was 8 weeks and I passed with a B and homework saved my grade giving that you can go back and improver score
"I really don\'t know where to begin about professor espana. WOW WOW WOW is all I can think of. This professors offers so much extra credit opportunities!!! Put your best effort in and you will pass. Trust me, this is coming from a student that almost didn\'t graduate high school because of math. Easy breezy beautiful miss espana."
She is awesome. She actually cares about her students. Her Exams are not hard and she offer so much extra credit its almost impossible to not pass. Easy A for sure TAKE HER
professor espana is a great person. she loves helping her students. if you pay attention in class and do the online homework you will definitely pass the class.
"AMAZING. Very clear, easy work. 10/10 would recommend. Very nice, give A LOT of extra credit, take advantage! I would definitely choose her as my professor again. Tests are super easy and you have so much extra credit you\'ll always pass."
"professor Lourdes is a great teacher she cares about you, gives test but very simple, tries to be funny and the homework is very simple and its online. i recommend any one to take her. you do not need the textbook but you do need the access code."
"Professor espana honestly tries to help everyone, she gives a lot of opportunities of extra credit and she cares about her students! Take her, it will be the best thing you\'ve ever done. Honestly make sure you study she will help you but you must try."
Amazing professor has a bit of OCD when it comes to papers and how he likes it done but a lot very easy very lenient and gives you opportunities to make up your assignments.
"Great professor, his class is really easy to pass. His work and essay topics are essay. Make sure to turn in work on time and you\'ll pass. My favorite thing about Allen is how he grades, he is not a tough grader at all. I don\'t write so good and all my essays have been higher than a B. His classes aren\'t boring so time goes by fast!"
Very good professor. Class is fun and grades very fairly.
"Professor Allen is very inspirational, if you like to write you will like them. He makes class entretaining and is very caring."
"Great professor. I would for sure take him again, I really enjoyed coming to class. Al l you have to do is come to class everyday on time and complete the assignments and you will pass. He is really fair and is willing to work with you to help you pass. But you must do your part."
"Prof Allen is a nice professor however he expects everyone to be a writer, I didnt like the class at all, and he used to make jokes all the time that were not funny. If you are good at writing take him, if not look for someone else, its no time an easy A"
"Preston Allen was one of the most weirdest but funniest professors I ever had. He would make a few face expressions that would make a few students laugh. He is straight forward with the work during the semester and how he want things done. You\'ll have around 3-4 essays with feedback provided after each one. Overall, great professor and you\'ll learn"
"Very interesting and FUN class. I learned so much from him. You will have to write a lot of research papers, but you will gain so much knowledge from each of them. He is very fair with grading. I would take his class again!"
Professor Allen is an amazing individual! I would definitly take his class again! He made it fun to learn about all the boring things of english!! Be sure to purchase one of the books he wrote they are awesome!!
"Charismatic man, do all of your work (essays and academic marks) and you will pass the class. You will not dread going to this class rather you will be excited to go."
i would take this professor again if i could. hes an amazing teacher and makes lectures very interesting and fun. you\'ll learn alot from his experiences and classwork. would definitely recommend. only 3 at home essays and 3 in class essays. he takes away the lowest grades from both. easy A and lots of fun
"Amazing teacher overall, there\'s 6 required assignments throughout the semester. Three in class essays and three home research papers. Overall he was an outstanding teacher, would definitely recommend."
I really dislike ENC classes and the semester I took ENC1102 I took 5 classes in total. Crazy to say that my favorite class this semester out of the 5 has been the ENC1102 class and it has been 100% due to Preston Allen\'s awesome lectures. He makes literature fun and makes you interested in what he is teaching. This professor is amazing.
Hes really funny in a weird type of way if you take him you\'ll see. The work isn\'t all that difficult and he is really lenient with when you turn it in as long as you email him explaining why you couldn\'t on the due date. Definitely going to try to take him for 1102. Shows a lot of videos and you pretty much just write responses to them
I completely disagree with most of the comments about Professor Johnson. The reason all of you think badly about her classes is simply because MATH IS HARD! I was never good at math but I got an A in her class simply because I payed attention! If you don\'t do good in her class it\'s simply because you did not pay attention!!!!!
"Very funny professor! 80% of his lecture is him telling stories. He gives out extra credit questions when attendance is low. Exams are really tricky! A lot of stuff is on them that was never covered in class. Also is slow to respond to emails, and to grade."
"He literally gives you everything you need to get an A. Technically, he even gives you the quizzes and exams. Just fill them out and study them and youre all good."
Very helpful with providing any additional help needed for this course!
"Nice guy, but AWFUL prof never hands things back and he is the most unorganized prof you will ever have. Does not have actual notes. Text book is very unclear. You won\'t know what you have in the class until final grades are in. Unless you have a lot of time to devote to this class do not take it! It is not an easy A!"
"Great professor, super nice. He is the type of professor who cares more about student\'s learning than grade, and actually means it. He is a super caring guy and really wants to help students. He has many great life stories to share and will not fail you as long as you show up and be respectful, and try. Easy class, and teaches a lot!"
Awesome guy a little slow grader but impossible to do bad i skipped a quiz and still got a 91
"Goes on pointless tangents a lot - tends to talk about himself more than about what we should actually be learning. Read the textbook if you want to pass, grades fairly but you need to put work into it in order to pass."
"He is an okay professor, he knows what he is talking about but he is pretty difficult. He grades speeches on the harsher side. It is not really easy for many people to speak in front of others and I feel like he forgets that. He always uses the way he speaks as an example but has been doing it for so long hes a pro while were still adjusting to it"
Olay is a professor that makes you work for the grade you want. There are 3/4 presentations and the last one is a group presentation. He grades outlines hard. As long as you come to class you\'ll pass. Textbook is only used for exam and final.
"Professor Olaye gives several projects throughout the semester. They are all public speaking presentations about different topics. All require an outline and PPT. Tests aren\'t too difficult. They\'re based off the textbook, which is super easy to read and understand. Put in the effort, listen to feedback, study, and you\'re all set. Great professor!"
Had Miller for biochem 2. It was more discussion based than lecture. It was bigger concepts than the niddy griddy stuff you learn in Biochem 1. Study and you will do fine. She\'s pretty fair in grading.
Best and most helpful professor I\'ve had at Millersville. Would not recommend skipping any lectures. But she is very useful at office hours and responds to emails quickly. I think the tests are fair and she prepares you for them in lectures. Plus homeworks are very easy and are good grade boosters
"Dr. Miller is awesome! I hated chemistry in high school and after taking her class I don\'t hate Chem (as much). She is so nice and willing to help if you ask her! Definitely take her if u need Chem 103. The class wasn\'t that hard. Just make sure you stay on top of the work. Homework on D2l is due every week and test are frequent, not too hard."
"Text for Stress Mgmt class unnecessary & waste of money, all covered in class. Dont see why the book is required. Spouting personal opinions & insulting medical documents is unprofessional. Makes inappropriate comments, creates uncomfortable environment. students arent allowed to leave class for bathroom, wont be allowed re entry...?"
Show up for class do all your assignments and any extra credit that is offered. Make sure you study the power point presentation and the word definitions that are listed in the chapters. If you do those steps you will pass the class with no problem. Make sure you are on time for class. Once the door is close we will not be allowed in the class
"Professor Martin really enjoys the subject of stress management. The techniques he taught in class really work and can help, they helped me a lot during Finals week. Do the extra credit and online homework nd study and you\'ll get an easy A."
"This is the only class that was difficult for me to get through. He teaches well, but he has very strict rules and regulations. He also can be very rude and mean, anger like. He is not understanding, if you have a crisis, funeral, children etc he does not care. No homework, and test based course only. Hard to bring your grade up."
"Bruce was wonderful. Not only did he teach me tons about meditation, stress management and prevention, he offered a wealth of other knowledge as well."
"I didn\'t realize the course would include a mandatory MLM presentation by a snake oil salesman for a product based on inaccurate nutrition information from a veterinarian. He pitches his other classes all the time and tries to bribe you to take them by offering extra credit in this course. He treats adults like children, and don\'t be late!"
"Class is relatively easy, the book helps but its not needed. As for the professor, he\'s a hit or miss. If you\'re late 10 minutes to class you\'ll only receive some credit for attendance. You\'re graded on 5 tests, online homework assignments and attendance. The tests are only 25 questions each but worth 100 points each. He can be very unprofessional."
"I took Peter Conti for both ENG111 and 151. This is a hybrid class, you only meet in class about 6 times for the whole semester. He is a tough grader and expects a lot from his students. He takes no excuses and if you don\'t do your work don\'t expect to pass. but he is a great professor overall I really did learn a lot from him."
This class was the main stress of the semester I hated it!! He thinks because he knows the subject everyone else does ! He makes you feel so stupid! He doesn\'t give good instructions! I worked my ass off and stressed more than I should have. Honestly take another professor spare yourself the trouble .
Great professor! Be prepared to do the work but the work is easy if you apply yourself. Deadlines matter but he gives enough time to complete it. Assignments are based on current events so it easily keeps interest!
"I took him for a hybrid class and at first I honestly thought that I was going to regret it because he seemed tough. After the first few assignments and in class lectures, I was really liking the class and him as a professor. He is a super cool guy. He loves to focus on music and artists that he likes. The topic papers are different and interesting"
Great professor. He is ALWAYS willing to help no matter what. He is definitely one of the best English professors that TCC has to offer.
"Mr. Potter is very good teacher. You do have to study, but he cares. He knows the material and will give you extra help if you want."
"He is very smart, very knowledgeable and easy with the homework. And he was generous when it came down to curving test grades."
I\'m not sure why he has a 3.5 when he deserves a 5.0. He\'s a wonderful professor and as long as you do the work .
You would not waste your time on his class. I wanted to become a better writer. I learned a lot from his class.
He is very funny. I would take him again.
"Best English professor ever, Very thoughtful. An easy A. Take this class if you want become a better writer."
I really appreciate him opening the new door for me. I think it was decent amount of homework. I learned a lot from him. It was a little hard to catch up in his class and the assignments at first but his lecture/feedback always makes sense and logical. He spared a lot of his time every time I asked questions. I would take his class again.
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Every single review on here is completely accurate. If you do not want this class to be your life, DO NOT TAKE. He is rude, condescending, and you do not learn in his class. His lectures do not pertain to the content. He assigns excess reading that is never covered. He also has very basic, if that, communication skills."
"Lectures well, but has a tendency to go off on tangents and can come off condescending at times. He takes forever to grade assignments, and grades as if you\'re a professional. His instructions are fairly clear, but the course is rigorous, and if you don\'t have time to sit down and plan essays out you\'ll be lucky to get out with a B."
He constantly goes off on tangents that don\'t connect with the lesson. If you miss one class might as well not show up for the rest of the semester.
Grades papers like you are a professional. All of my papers I never got better than a C grade on. He rambles on things that do not have anything to do with the work. I WOULD NOT TAKE HIM AGAIN.
"Online classes have always been tricky, and intro to lit is no exception. I accidentally sighed up for the 8 week class and with 5 other classes--it was brutal. I didn\'t flunk, but the workload was a lot. He doesn\'t give encouraging comments, least none that I ever got. So it can sometimes feel like your lost and unsure how to improve your work."
"Professor Potter was impersonal, was weeks/ months late in grading assignments, and was extremely disorganized. If not for what I knew from high school, I would not have passed this class. Over half of the students dropped out. I learned how to guess my way through unclear assignments and how to use his last-minute feedback in my prepared essays."
I wanted to become a better writer. This was the class to take. Mr. Potter did not waste my time and his process works.
