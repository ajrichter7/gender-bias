To Whom it May Concern:

I am delighted to recommend Frito for a position with your company.  I have known Frito for an astounding fifteen years, and I have seen him grow from an adorable kitten to a mature, self-assured elderly cat.  He will be perfect in the role he’s applying for - namely, food critic and quality control in the wet cat food industry.

Frito works okay with others, and works great by himself. He spent over 14 years with a litter-mate, and he learned to adjust to the other cat’s tendencies. As a kitten Frito dominated the scene, but as he moved towards middle age he gave up his territorial nature and even warmed up to the other cat.  

Frito is especially passionate about the contents of wet food, due to his many acquired allergies over the years. He is a connoisseur of paté, especially when he developed an allergy to beef, pork, chicken, and eggs (and probably other stuff). He is now a specialist in seafood, especially salmon.  On top of his allergies, Frito is also a particularly picky eater. He can identify good brands and bad brands, and sometimes he even turns his nose up at a new can of his favorite variety if it isn’t exactly the way he wants it. 

His food limitations doesn’t prevent him from acquiring human food on the regular. He is a big fan of butter, and doesn’t let the inevitable stomach issues dampen his mood. Frito has managed to grab french fries, chicken skin, and even a tamale.  He is tenacious when he knows what he wants.

Frito proves the orange cat stereotype wrong - he is conniving, he learns from his mistakes, and when motivated he will be an outstanding contributor to your team. I highly recommend Frito for your position.

Sincerely, 
Anna
