To whom it may concern,

I'm writing to recommend Faith to your organization. In my 7 years of collaboration 
with her, Faith has demonstrate superb skills of expression. She's well-rounded for a
wide range of work across different styles and cultural context. She can produce deep,
warm sounds full of colors in the low register and a crystal, bright tone in the higher
notes. Faith has excellent abilities to collaborate with coworkers from very different 
backgrounds. She blends perfectly with Mr. Cello who's three times her height and five
times her weight, as they communicate and split the work in a way that suits each of their
ability the best. Faith is very intelligent and always receive instructions correctly and
responsively; she can even identify the subtle differences in her manager's body language
and adjust her execution accordingly. However, Faith is not an emotionless robot; to the 
contrary, she always has her own character and performs her manager's command with her own
interpretation, yet she understands her manager's idea so well that the outcome has always
been appropriate. Faith has a special place in my heart for the above reasons, and I believe
that you will find her a valuable addition to your orchestra.

Sincerely,
Living Yi
