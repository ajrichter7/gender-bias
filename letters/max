To whom it may concern, 

I’m writing this letter to recommend my kitten, Goose, for the graduate program at Harvard 
kitten academy.  She is already an esteemed bug catcher at her young age, and if I ever hear an 
untoward buzzing I’m quick to call on her vocational expertise. She has an easygoing and kind 
demeanor and is quick to purr. Goose plays well with everyone: she’s formed close bonds with her 
cat-parents and her sister, Mica, and is welcoming and affectionate with other foster kittens she 
works with. She was an inspiring and collaborative figure in my work from home environment and 
showed great leadership qualities leading me to the food she wanted me to serve for her. Her 
commanding presence and gravitas sometimes threatens to draw me away from my work but they 
ultimately work to the advantage of the team by inspiring me to great heights—I do it for her. I’m 
confident Goose would be an asset to your program and to Harvard as an institution, plus I think 
she would look very cute in a graduation cap.

Yours,
Dr. Bennett
