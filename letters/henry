I've known Licorice for over 12 years now, and she's been a delight in every sense of the word. When she told me she was pursuing business school, I was overjoyed. I believe she has the skills, innate and learned, to qualify her as an excellent candidate for Harvard Business School. Licorice's enthusiasm about what she does is unmatched. She has proven to be excellent in response to training, learning quickly the bounds of her role and the necessity of not jumping on guests when they arrive in the house. She is ambitious to a fault, and has proven to be quite crafty, even when it's not exactly desired. She's a known escape artist, frequently known to have taken long uninvited tours of the neighborhood vis-a-vis digging under the backyard fence. This is not meant as a black mark, though, as she exposed vital security flaws in such fence system, which our team was able to securely patch. Furthermore, her scent proliferation did a fantastic job of keeping the rabbits away from our tomato plants. Once Licorice was given external stimulus during these uninvited visits, most memorably in the form of an unlucky groundhog, she was extremely willing to be directly adherent to the instructions of management, and returned immediately to campus to deposit the victim. I believe, from this and similar experiences, that what some may perceive as potential insubordination on Licorice's behalf is resultant of our potential misuse of her role as a Retriever. Licorice's primary responsibility in our firm was to sleep all day, and I believe that given the opportunity to apply her talents at HBS, she will absolutely thrive.
