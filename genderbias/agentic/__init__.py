Letters for women are less likely to include agentic words.

"Prior research found that agentic terms were more frequent in letters for men
and communal terms were more frequent in letters for women. Agentic behaviors
at work include speaking assertively, influencing others, and initiating tasks.
Corresponding communal behaviors include being concerned with the welfare of
others (i.e., descriptions of kindness, sympathy, sensitivity, and nurturance),
helping others, accepting othersâ€™ direction, and maintaining relationships."
(Madera et al. 2009)

Goal: Combine this with communal detector.
